1.2 (Apr 10 2021)
- First Beta Release


1.3 (May 2021)
Loot and Rewards
- Added locked chests which are scattered around the dungeon. Each floor is guaranteed to have at least one locked chest but is likely to have more be locked. You can either pick them or unlock them
- Added key drops and lockpick drops around the dungeon. You can find them in debris piles, but not chests.
- Added handcuffs trap, which places a set of handcuffs on you that has a guaranteed lock on it
- Added harness trap, which locks you in a harness that makes it easy for enemies to grab onto you
- Added a kinky belt trap to keep you aroused
- Added various other restraints from chests
- Added scaling to the kinds of locks you encounter:
- New locks:
	Red locks are the most common in early levels, and can be only opened with red keys.
	Green locks are less common, and have a chance of jamming, making them impossible to unlock.
	Yellow locks require both a red and a green key to unlock.
	Blue locks require blue keys, and can't be picked or cut off.
Shrines
- Added Shrines! These allow you to offer gold and will basically take restraints off in exchange.
- Shrines for the goddesses of the elements, conjuration, and illusion who grant spells
Balance
- Made the rope snare have a 3 turn delay rather than a 1 turn delay, and a range of 1. This limits its in-combat use, while retaining its long duration and level 1 classification
- Willpower no longer regenerates, instead you must find a willpower shrine to regenerate your willpower. The cost increases exponentially.
- Conjure Slime now doesn't last forever, but stuns enemies for longer
- Various other tweaks and fixes
Mechanics
- Enemies now have resistances and weaknesses. Discover them the hard way!
- Miscast chance: While aroused, you have a chance of spells being either cast on your position or blowing up in your face and hitting you!

- Some enemies (like the new witches) can open doors! Beware!
- Vibrators have a charge which is increased by casting spells.
New Enemies:
- Added a new enemy, a rope snake that sacrifices itself to wrap you up!
- Shock witches that cast electrical spells at you from a distance
- Chain witch who fights by throwing chains at you. She will attempt to close the gap, and will lock the chains in place if she gets near!
- Slime witch that hurls slime balls and conjures pools of slime at you! She is a formidable opponent, be careful not to get trapped against her as she can create tremendous amounts of slime!
Spells
- Electrify spell which is a delayed blast that also briefly stuns
- Chain bolt spell which stuns enemies
- Slime ball spell which conjures a ball of slime that leaves a sticky trail. Use with caution!
- Shield and Barrier, two Conjuration spells for blocking projectiles
- Shroud, a defensive spell which makes melee more difficult inside an area
- Mistcall and Leap, teleportation spells with different strengths and weaknesses. Mistcall uses verrbal components so it can be used to escape from a sticky situation.
Other
- New brickwork visuals
- The map has more doors, but some of them will be open at the start of the game. You can close them to prevent zombies from chasing you.
- Added Undressing System. Certain things will pull clothes off, you gain distraction when this happens and visually will blush when extremely naked and aroused.

Gameplay Overhaul
- Removed willpower. Stamina is the primary resource now for determining whether the player gets captured
- New consequences when an enemy closes the gap and you have 0 stamina
- Stamina is overhauled. It does not regen except when sleeping. You can click a button to sleep for 20 turns to regain 20 stamina. If you are attacked then you wake up automatically, but you are blinded while sleeping so you won't be able to see enemies coming. You can cancel sleep by hitting any key.
- Mana is now a separate resource. It does not regenerate, but mana potions can restore it.
- Each shrine now has a mana pool. You can drink mana from any of the mana pools once per floor without repercussions. This restores your mana fully. Drinking more than once on the same floor (from any number of shrines), however, has a chance to backfire.

TODO
Warden (more comprehensive cuffs)
Detective (Stealth, wanders around laying traps throughout the level)
Nurse (applies straitjackets and stuff)
Doctors (Applies sedatives and euphoric drugs)
Troopers (Riot shield and tasers)

Enemy ideas:
-Silent sentinel, triggers ambush when the player casts a verbal spell, tries to gag the player

Future content planned:
- Wand item which reduces mana costs but is terrible for melee
- Slimes which clean up items, dissolve doors, and potentially corrupt traps and such
- Slimes that catch your sword and trap it
- Exit stair puzzles (like for example a button or special key somewhere in the level, maybe with a high likelihood of traps)
- Rats should have a kleptomaniac AI that steals items and holds them, drops them on death, and runs away from the player when confronted
- Tranquilizer/stamina drain from an enemy (bandits? raiders?)
- Latex witches that cast latex imprisonment spells at you from a distance
- New shrine: chastity goddess. Places you in a set of magic cuffs that prevent you from being restrained in those slots. However if your stamina falls below half, the cuffs snap together until you get back to full stamina!
- locked doors that trigger when you step on an obvious looking brickwork that's only generated on tiles you can avoid, maybe with some sort of sleep gas hazard or something to force a time limit if you cant progress
- Monster Encyclopedia
- Heels of avoiding traps: Causes all traps and dangerous terrain (slime, ice) to not affect the player

Spell Ideas:
- Divine Cuffs, a spell which gives you glowing arm and leg cuffs that block low level restraints from being put on you. Lasts for the whole floor.
- Sleep, puts nearby creatures with low willpower to sleep until they take damage. Works on zombies, and also the player if the player is at low stamina.
