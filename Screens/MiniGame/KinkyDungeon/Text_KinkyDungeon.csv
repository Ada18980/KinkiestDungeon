KinkyDungeonLore0,"(Preface from the journal of Catherine Willows, well-known explorer who vanished in the dungeon 30 years ago) I am writing this journal in the off chance that I do not come back in my search for the Mistress' staff. If you find this, please make an effort to deliver it back to the surface for the good of all the young women lured by its secrets."
KinkyDungeonLore1,"(Pg. 24 from Catherine Willows' journal) Many who trowel the upper levels of the Mistress' tomb often ask rhetorically: 'Why are there weird kinky traps guarding treasure chests? Why not have real, deadly traps if the purpose is to dissuade intruders?'"
KinkyDungeonLore2,"(Pg. 25 from Catherine Willows' journal) ...They make a crucial mistake: The treasure chests aren't trapped. Rather, they are full of gold. And we know that gold is pleasing to the gods: our economy runs on it, and the gods only make interventions in our day-to-day affairs because we give them gold. Lesser gods, known as spirits, also love gold, but unlike the gods we know, these lesser spirits cannot consume gold on an altar in one fell swoop like the gods can. Therefore, they need to physically inhabit the place where the gold sits, slowly draining it of its pleasing essence."
KinkyDungeonLore3,"(Pg. 26 from Catherine Willows' journal) So the question is not "why did somebody lay these traps." The answer is that they are not traps at all. I surmise that the upper floors were once a place of offering for the dead. And when the old civilization perished and the entire complex sank into the ground, there was no longer anyone to drive the spirits away and keep them from inhabiting the upstairs. As for why there are so many restraints in general rather than your typical sort of spirits... well we know what the Mistress surrounded herself with."
KinkyDungeonLore4,"(The note starts with a drawing of a witch with many chains hanging from her body) She can block melee attacks with her chains. However, they conduct lightning and heat directly to her body, and I was able to take out her chains with bolt cutters."
KinkyDungeonLore5,"(The note starts with a drawing of a witch with lightning crackling from her fingertips) Water will cause her to short-circuit. I can't seem to hit her with lightning, though. She always redirects it."
KinkyDungeonLore6,"(The note starts with a drawing of a witch whose body is partly gelatinous) The slime is non-flammable and my attacks pass right through her body... Lightning and ice seem to be effective!"
KinkyDungeonLore7,"(The note is from a famous escape artist) Many restraints are applied quite tightly by a skilled rigger. Even removing it will be tough without thrashing around a bit to loosen it."
KinkyDungeonLore8,"(The note is from a famous escape artist) Anything can be unbuckled with enough patience. Having a finger extension such as a lockpick will help. Ultimately, though, what matters is that you have a calm state of mind, free from distraction and hopelessness."
KinkyDungeonLore9,"(The note is from a famous cartographer) In my lapse of judgement, I decided to borrow some mana from the nearby shrine to the Latex goddess. While there was no immediate response to my faux pas, I soon found myself pursued by a swarm of slimes!"
KinkyDungeonLore10,"(A letter between bandit leaders) One of my subordinates has been reporting a girl bound in heavy leather restraints running around. I told her that this is normal, people keep all kinds of servants around here. But definitely keep an eye out for intruders! Don't let them fool you!"
KinkyDungeonLore11,"(The note is a letter from the school of conjuration) We really would like to know... why did you summon a frog in the laboratory? People are wondering, you know. One of the student's projects got eaten."
KinkyDungeonLore12,"(You find a carving on the floor, a half-finished magic circle of celestial conjuration. Perhaps a cleric wished to call forth an angel for guidance, before realizing there was a shrine a short walk away, where she could contact the heavens much more easily.)"
KinkyDungeonLore13,"(It looks like a... receipt) Thank you for your offering to CELESTIAL COMMERCE. Please accept this fine-quality steel blade as compensation for your continued devotion and selflessness."
KinkyDungeonLore14,"(A note written in cursive) To whomever assaulted our courier and left them tied up here: The shrines of the Goddess of ILLUSION are NOT to be used in this manner. If you desire a subject for your lewd experimentations, please attempt to do so on one of the locals and for heaven's sake do not call up an angelic courier just so you may tie her up. It does not matter than she consented, nor that you paid, our couriers have responsibilities that they must attend to. Signed: HERONA, enforcer of the GODDESS of ILLUSIONS."
KinkyDungeonLore15,"(From an essay titled 'On Celestial Supply Chains') It is known that the heavens seek gold. We do not know why it is that the heavens seek it, but we do know that the Goddesses grant us fragments of their limitless power in exchange for this otherwise-useless metal we dredge up from the earth. They care about it so much that shrines are commonplace, each hosting an angelic courier lying in wait for any adventurer willing to part with hers."
KinkyDungeonLore16,"They say that the maiden who safeguards the graveyard is kind to her pets..."
KinkyDungeonLore17,"They thought they could have my legendary blade... but the fools forgot to tie my legs! I was able to Blink out of jail and into the hallway where they kept all my things!"
KinkyDungeonLore18,"I am writing this from inside prison. Who would have known they cared so much about me using a shrine? Sheesh."

KinkyDungeonLore19,"(A drawing of a bunch of zombies, ordered by danger level. Of note are a zombie surrounded by charms, a zombie surrounded by talismans, a zombie warrior with a sword, and... some kind of shrine maiden that you've never seen before)"

KinkyDungeonLore20,"(An excerpt from BONDAGE WITCHERY: A STUDENT'S GUIDE) The first thing to understand is that tying someone up is difficult if they are not in a vulnerable position. If your opponent is vulnerable, then binding will be twice as effective!"
KinkyDungeonLore21,"(An excerpt from BONDAGE WITCHERY: A STUDENT'S GUIDE) Once your opponent is nicely trussed up, you can break their will by ticking them with a Feather, Ice Cube, or Magic Wand."
KinkyDungeonLore22,"(An excerpt from BONDAGE WITCHERY: A STUDENT'S GUIDE) Bigger and more resilient opponents are much more effective at breaking out of your binds. Try to deal some damage to them to decrease the speed at which they struggle out of your restraints."


KinkyDungeonLore101,"(A drawing of a suit of armor. It reads: DO NOT TRUST)"
KinkyDungeonLore102,"(The note starts with a drawing of a witch in dark robes with bright pink hair) A necromancer. Powerful spellcaster, weak up close."
KinkyDungeonLore103,"I can't count how many skeletons I've bashed with my hammer today. They seem so fragile..."
KinkyDungeonLore104,"(The note is scrawled with wiggling lines) IT SEES ME. I SHOULDN'T HAVE DEFILED THE ROPE GODDESS' ALTAR!"
KinkyDungeonLore105,"It is said that fire and water are opposite planes, but I've noticed that the relation is more lopsided than 'equal and opposite' when they physically manifest. Water elementals resist fire, obviously, but fire elementals are weak to water! It is almost as if the abundance of water in this world causes the fire elementals to become weaker than in their home plane..."
KinkyDungeonLore106,"A drawing of many icicles around pools of water. It instructs you to avoid the pools of water and you can see a figure surrounded by ice shards in the distance being set on fire and smashed with a hammer."
KinkyDungeonLore107,"The shadow spirits' touch is cold as ice... I have wondered if this temperature property applies to their destructive effects on other types of beings. Unfortunately, I found out the hard way when I tried to summon a shadow creature against an ice elemental..."
KinkyDungeonLore108,"I was being chased by something fast and heavy, and it was about to crush me when I tossed an Ice Shard behind me. It stopped and I didn't care to look back."
KinkyDungeonLore109,"I was walking in the library when I got attacked by a magic book! Fortunately my sword seemed to disapatch it quickly, and I used my spear to stab another one shortly after."
KinkyDungeonLore110,"SOMEBODY STABBED MY FROG AND I AM PISSED."
KinkyDungeonLore111,"I don't think it's neccessary to tell people that dragons resist fire... right?"
KinkyDungeonLore112,"I've been studying the dragonheart's weaknesses. So far I've found that the ones bearing the powers of ice dragons are actually weak to fire unlike the others, and the ones who summon crystals to block attacks are nonetheless unable to grab a spear to stop it from reaching them."

KinkyDungeonLore1100,"They say a ninja can catch a sword in her hands, but can she stop a spear? Ha, thought not!"
KinkyDungeonLore1101,"(Pg. 54 from Catherine Willows' journal): The post-collapse civilization sought immortality, but they knew that the technologies of the old civilization were a danger to them. So they turned to another school of thought: Magic."
KinkyDungeonLore1102,"(Pg. 55 from Catherine Willows' journal): Silk wrappings, enchanted with ten-thousand microscopic runes per cubit, were suffucient to protect their bodies from ageing for millenia. What they didn't realize was that the magic didn't protect their souls."
KinkyDungeonLore1103,"(Pg. 56 from Catherine Willows' journal): They have no clue what they are doing anymore. To them, this is just another one of their ten-thousand dreams across the aeons. They can no longer tell reality from imagination."
KinkyDungeonLore1104,"Ninjas aren't so tough to fight when their hands are tied behind their back. Good thing I had my pet slime with me~"
KinkyDungeonLore1105,"(Pg. 12 from Catherine Willows' addendum): After studying the ancient race of catlike people, I have come to the conclusion that their race met a dual fate. All of them received eternal life in some form or another. To one half it manifested as a blessing, allowing them to walk the halls. To the other it became a curse to them, trapping them in runic wrappings for all eternity."
KinkyDungeonLore1106,"(Pg. 13 from Catherine Willows' addendum): I must issue a correction to the statements written in my journal. The ancients knew what they were doing. Those that were cursed, are blessed, and those who were blessed, are cursed."
KinkyDungeonLore1107,"(It's a copy of an ancient illustration, depicting a cat goddess, an elven goddess, and two groups of catgirls. One group is smiling and standing on pedestals. The other group is frowning and wearing armor meant for war. It looks unfinished, like the author was suddenly grabbed from behind while drawing it)"
KinkyDungeonLore1108,"(It's a interlinear translation of an ancient letter) Your highness, I have delivered to you the prisoners that you have asked. They are the worst of the worst--thieves, slanderers, sorcerers and seducers. But I must inquire, why is it that we must wrap them in silken scarves, worth twenty gold pieces each? Surely they are being handed over to be disciplined, not to be anointed?"
KinkyDungeonLore1109,"(It's a record of an interview)|ME: Why are you like this?|MUMMY: Because we are blessed!|ME: Blessed? You've been wrapped up for thousands of years!|MUMMY: A thousand years is nothing compared to the glory that will come!|ME: Why do you have to be wrapped up? There are plenty of you who aren't...|MUMMY: The chosen ones will inherit the land when the goddess returns."
KinkyDungeonLore1110,"(It's a record of an interview)|ME: Which goddess are you referring to? The goddess of restoration?|MUMMY: The blessed kitty.. she was promised to rule over the lesser goddesses.|ME: Lesser goddesses? Which ones?|MUMMY: YOUR goddesses. The ones you humans created that should not be. Ours is the true offspring of the creators, a goddess created to rule!"
KinkyDungeonLore1111,"(It's a record of an interview)|ME: What of the elves? Don't they talk about a 'kingdom' too?|MUMMY: Who are the elves?|ME: You know, pointy ears, green hair, a heck of an attitude... they seem in tune with nature.|MUMMY: They sound arrogant.|ME: They are.|MUMMY: Perhaps they know nothing of the promise between our goddess and theirs."
KinkyDungeonLore1112,"(It's a medical record) Patient seems stable... application of the enchanted cloth seems to have stopped the bleeding. It appears that the ancient magic suppresses all forms of injury, even in humans, until it is taken off."

KinkyDungeonLore201,"Those damn slimes! They're so sticky and gross... fortunately, I washed myself in the fountain the last time I got caught by one. It came right off!"
KinkyDungeonLore202,"The dragonhearts were a group of dragonslayers, named for their ritual that imbues them with the fiery power and resistance of dragons they've slain. Now they work as mercenaries, and some of them serve a certain Leather goddess."
KinkyDungeonLore203,"Yes! I've done it! I have created another red slime! I shall call him Fred, yes, Fred... after the slime I lost in a Shield-related accident a while back... poor Fred... I miss him."
KinkyDungeonLore204,"(Pg. 70 from Catherine Willows' journal): The underground jungle is a curious phenomenon. The level of light pouring through cracks in the ceiling is nonetheless too sparse to sustain plantlife. And yet the restoration goddess, in her ancient wisdom, has decided to preserve this place. How many of her dryads must I pierce or burn until she realizes I am merely passing through?"
KinkyDungeonLore205,"The unseen maid is the deadliest."
