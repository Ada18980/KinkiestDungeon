(Preface from the journal of Catherine Willows, well-known explorer who vanished in the dungeon 30 years ago) I am writing this journal in the off chance that I do not come back in my search for the Mistress' staff. If you find this, please make an effort to deliver it back to the surface for the good of all the young women lured by its secrets.
(Preface from the journal of Catherine Willows, well-known explorer who vanished in the dungeon 30 years ago) I am writing this journal in the off chance that I do not come back in my search for the Mistress' staff. If you find this, please make an effort to deliver it back to the surface for the good of all the young women lured by its secrets.
(Pg. 24 from Catherine Willows' journal) Many who trowel the upper levels of the Mistress' tomb often ask rhetorically: 'Why are there weird kinky traps guarding treasure chests? Why not have real, deadly traps if the purpose is to dissuade intruders?'
(Pg. 24 from Catherine Willows' journal) Many who trowel the upper levels of the Mistress' tomb often ask rhetorically: 'Why are there weird kinky traps guarding treasure chests? Why not have real, deadly traps if the purpose is to dissuade intruders?'
(Pg. 25 from Catherine Willows' journal) ...They make a crucial mistake: The treasure chests aren't trapped. Rather, they are full of gold. And we know that gold is pleasing to the gods: our economy runs on it, and the gods only make interventions in our day-to-day affairs because we give them gold. Lesser gods, known as spirits, also love gold, but unlike the gods we know, these lesser spirits cannot consume gold on an altar in one fell swoop like the gods can. Therefore, they need to physically inhabit the place where the gold sits, slowly draining it of its pleasing essence.
(Pg. 25 from Catherine Willows' journal) ...They make a crucial mistake: The treasure chests aren't trapped. Rather, they are full of gold. And we know that gold is pleasing to the gods: our economy runs on it, and the gods only make interventions in our day-to-day affairs because we give them gold. Lesser gods, known as spirits, also love gold, but unlike the gods we know, these lesser spirits cannot consume gold on an altar in one fell swoop like the gods can. Therefore, they need to physically inhabit the place where the gold sits, slowly draining it of its pleasing essence.
(Pg. 26 from Catherine Willows' journal) So the question is not why did somebody lay these traps. The answer is that they are not traps at all. I surmise that the upper floors were once a place of offering for the dead. And when the old civilization perished and the entire complex sank into the ground, there was no longer anyone to drive the spirits away and keep them from inhabiting the upstairs. As for why there are so many restraints in general rather than your typical sort of spirits... well we know what the Mistress surrounded herself with.

We do not know why it is that the heavens seek it, but we do know that the Goddesses grant us fragments of their limitless power in exchange for this otherwise-useless metal we dredge up from the earth. They care about it so much that shrines are commonplace, each hosting an angelic courier lying in wait for any adventurer willing to part with hers.
