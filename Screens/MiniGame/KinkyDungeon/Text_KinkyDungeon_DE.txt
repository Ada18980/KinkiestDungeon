### (A page from the Book of Aeons)|The 'Graveyard' is a peculiar place. Long ago, human beings lived and died just like the animals. When the Old Civilization existed, they would come to bury their dead in the Graveyard. It remains a mystery why so many of the former dead seem to be alive. Some say that when the Old Civilization cast the spell that spell which overcame Death, even those buried in their graves would rise again. Others simply say that there is a powerful necromancer who lives here, toying with the dead as if they were pets...
### (A page from the Book of Aeons)|Beneath the Graveyard lies a relic of a former age, a network of tombs inhabited by the immortal followers of Bast. Very few were graced with this gift of immortality before the great archmagus, Sariel Vinlaga, stole this power from the gods and granted all humans with the power of immortality. The Bast followers are still set in their ways, hoping for a time when their Goddess will return and rebuild their glorious civilization.
### (A page from the Book of Aeons)|Some say the 'Catacombs' are older than time itself. When the Old Civilization began to study immortality, no one knew if it would be possible to bring back those who already died. The Catacombs therefore were used to store all of the remains of former humans, so that they too could be revived when the archmagus would finally make her breakthrough.
### (A page from the Book of Aeons)|They say that Archmagus Sariel Vinlaga studied in this very library. Having gathered together all of human knowledge, magical, spiritual, technological, she tasked her twelve lesser magi with the job of sorting and collating the wealth of knowledge she had acquired. No one knows why she suddenly abandoned it, or why it remains in such disrepair today.
### (A page from the Book of Aeons)|The Overgown Ruins remain a puzzle to scholars. Hardly any light comes through the cracks in the ceiling, and yet the area teems with life. It is known that the regenerative powers that keep humans from dying relies on an individual's own mana supply. So how do plants and beasts without mana survive? The devout say it is the Goddess of Restoration who preserves the jungle, but could it be that the Old Civilization developed a means of sustaining life underground? 
### (A page from the Book of Aeons)|The problem of Energy has plagued civilization for millenia. Before the leylines were discovered, humankind relied on natural sources of power such as rivers and firewood. When the Crystal Caves were discovered, a great revolution occurred. No longer reliant on natural sources, civilizations could tap the wellsprings of chaotic energy underground to power machinery like never seen before.
### (A page from the Book of Aeons)|The 'Lost Temple' as they call it, is a subject of great speculation. It seems that its creators worshipped only four creator goddesses, rather than all the Eight. It was perhaps abandoned several hundred years ago when a flood caused great panic, and it seems that this must have occurred before humanity was made immortal by the archmagus, as there are many remains still found inside.
### (A page from the Book of Aeons)|The Stars have been a mystery to scholars since the beginning of time. At one point, humans believed that every star was a god, and they made offerings by throwing sugar into the night, thinking that as the stars were innumerable, so were the grains of sugar that pleased humans so much. Religion has moved past that, but the Orrery remains a relic from a time when humanity worshipped the stars rather than the Eight.
### (A page from the Book of Aeons)|The 'Bellows' is the nickname given to the primitive facilities of the Old Civilization, buried deep beneath the ground. While much of it remains in disrepair, many of the Old Civilization's successors have attempted to keep it in good working order, as the technology is precious and impossible to replicate with modern methods. It seems that many of these successors have fallen prey to some delusions about its purpose, as much of the equipment preserved has little use aside from collecting prisoners.

### (Preface from the journal of Catherine Willows, well-known explorer who vanished in the dungeon 30 years ago) I am writing this journal in the off chance that I do not come back in my search for the Mistress' staff. If you find this, please make an effort to deliver it back to the surface for the good of all the young women lured by its secrets.
### (Pg. 24 from Catherine Willows' journal) Many who trowel the upper levels of the Mistress' tomb often ask rhetorically: 'Why are there weird kinky traps guarding treasure chests? Why not have real, deadly traps if the purpose is to dissuade intruders?'
### (Pg. 25 from Catherine Willows' journal) ...They make a crucial mistake: The treasure chests aren't trapped. Rather, they are full of gold. And we know that gold is pleasing to the gods: our economy runs on it, and the gods only make interventions in our day-to-day affairs because we give them gold. Lesser gods, known as spirits, also love gold, but unlike the gods we know, these lesser spirits cannot consume gold on an altar in one fell swoop like the gods can. Therefore, they need to physically inhabit the place where the gold sits, slowly draining it of its pleasing essence.
### (Pg. 26 from Catherine Willows' journal) So the question is not 'why did somebody lay these traps.' The answer is that they are not traps at all. I surmise that the upper floors were once a place of offering for the dead. And when the old civilization perished and the entire complex sank into the ground, there was no longer anyone to drive the spirits away and keep them from inhabiting the upstairs. As for why there are so many restraints in general rather than your typical sort of spirits... well we know what the Mistress surrounded herself with.
### (The note starts with a drawing of a witch with many chains hanging from her body) She can block melee attacks with her chains. However, they conduct lightning and heat directly to her body, and I was able to take out her chains with bolt cutters.
### (The note starts with a drawing of a witch with lightning crackling from her fingertips) Water will cause her to short-circuit. I can't seem to hit her with lightning, though. She always redirects it.
### (The note starts with a drawing of a witch whose body is partly gelatinous) The slime is non-flammable and my attacks pass right through her body... Lightning and ice seem to be effective!
### (The note is from a famous escape artist) Many restraints are applied quite tightly by a skilled rigger. Even removing it will be tough without thrashing around a bit to loosen it.
### (The note is from a famous escape artist) Anything can be unbuckled with enough patience. Having a finger extension such as a lockpick will help. Ultimately, though, what matters is that you have a calm state of mind, free from distraction and hopelessness.
### (The note is from a famous cartographer) In my lapse of judgement, I decided to borrow some mana from the nearby shrine to the Latex goddess. While there was no immediate response to my faux pas, I soon found myself pursued by a swarm of slimes!
### (A letter between bandit leaders) One of my subordinates has been reporting a girl bound in heavy leather restraints running around. I told her that this is normal, people keep all kinds of servants around here. But definitely keep an eye out for intruders! Don't let them fool you!
### (The note is a letter from the school of conjuration) We really would like to know... why did you summon a frog in the laboratory? People are wondering, you know. One of the student's projects got eaten.
### (You find a carving on the floor, a half-finished magic circle of celestial conjuration. Perhaps a cleric wished to call forth an angel for guidance, before realizing there was a shrine a short walk away, where she could contact the heavens much more easily.)
### (It looks like a... receipt) Thank you for your offering to CELESTIAL COMMERCE. Please accept this fine-quality steel blade as compensation for your continued devotion and selflessness.
### (A note written in cursive) To whomever assaulted our courier and left them tied up here: The shrines of the Goddess of ILLUSION are NOT to be used in this manner. If you desire a subject for your lewd experimentations, please attempt to do so on one of the locals and for heaven's sake do not call up an angelic courier just so you may tie her up. It does not matter that she consented, nor that you paid, our couriers have responsibilities that they must attend to. Signed: HERONA, enforcer of the GODDESS of ILLUSIONS.
### (From an essay titled 'On Celestial Supply Chains') It is known that the heavens seek gold. We do not know why it is that the heavens seek it, but we do know that the Goddesses grant us fragments of their limitless power in exchange for this otherwise-useless metal we dredge up from the earth. They care about it so much that shrines are commonplace, each hosting an angelic courier lying in wait for any adventurer willing to part with hers.
### They say that the maiden who safeguards the graveyard is kind to her pets...
### They thought they could have my legendary blade... but the fools forgot to tie my legs! I was able to Portal out of jail and into the hallway where they kept all my things!
### I am writing this from inside prison. Who would have known they cared so much about me using a shrine? Sheesh.

### (A drawing of a bunch of zombies, ordered by danger level. Of note are a zombie surrounded by charms, a zombie surrounded by talismans, a zombie warrior with a sword, and... some kind of shrine maiden that you've never seen before)

### (An excerpt from BONDAGE WITCHERY: A STUDENT'S GUIDE)|The first thing to understand is that tying someone up is difficult if they are not in a vulnerable position. If your opponent is vulnerable, then binding will be twice as effective!
### (An excerpt from BONDAGE WITCHERY: A STUDENT'S GUIDE)|Once your opponent is nicely trussed up, you can break their will by tickling them with a Feather, Ice Cube, or Magic Wand. This will deal extra damage.
### (An excerpt from BONDAGE WITCHERY: A STUDENT'S GUIDE)|Bigger and more resilient opponents are much more effective at breaking out of your binds. Try to deal some damage to them to decrease the speed at which they struggle out of your restraints.
### (An excerpt from BONDAGE WITCHERY: A STUDENT'S GUIDE)|Many mages utilize magical runes to set traps. If you want to check for traps, try learning the spell 'Magical Sight' in the Illusion school.

### From Adventuring 101: A guide to combat|Your opponent will become vulnerable in many ways, such as missing you with an attack. You can also teleport to the other side of them when they are attacking you, and this will confuse them briefly.|Vulnerable enemies take extra damage, and are easier to tie up!
### From Adventuring 101: A guide to combat|Drenching your opponents makes them more vulnerable to ice and electricity, but may increase their resistance to fire.
### From Adventuring 101: A guide to combat|Hitting enemies with melee damage while they are frozen will break the ice, but this also doubles the damage dealt by the attack.
### From Adventuring 101: A guide to combat|Did you know that hitting enemies with fire while they are frozen is extra powerful? Enemies take 40% additional damage from fire while frozen, although fire will rapidly unfreeze them.
### From Adventuring 101: A guide to combat|When you're in a bind, try to play along and look for an opportunity to escape. Fighting back will only make your enemies want to tighten your restraints.

### (A drawing of a suit of armor. It reads: DO NOT TRUST)
### (The note starts with a drawing of a witch in dark robes with bright pink hair) A necromancer. Powerful spellcaster, weak up close.
### I can't count how many skeletons I've bashed with my hammer today. They seem so fragile...
### (The note is scrawled with wiggling lines) IT SEES ME. I SHOULDN'T HAVE DEFILED THE ROPE GODDESS' ALTAR!
### It is said that fire and water are opposite planes, but I've noticed that the relation is more lopsided than 'equal and opposite' when they physically manifest. Water elementals resist fire, obviously, but fire elementals are weak to water! It is almost as if the abundance of water in this world causes the fire elementals to become weaker than in their home plane...
### A drawing of many icicles around pools of water. It instructs you to avoid the pools of water and you can see a figure surrounded by ice shards in the distance being set on fire and smashed with a hammer.
### The shadow spirits' touch is cold as ice... I have wondered if this temperature property applies to their destructive effects on other types of beings. Unfortunately, I found out the hard way when I tried to summon a shadow creature against an ice elemental...
### I was being chased by something fast and heavy, and it was about to crush me when I tossed an Ice Shard behind me. It stopped and I didn't care to look back.
### I was walking in the library when I got attacked by a magic book! Fortunately my sword seemed to disapatch it quickly, and I used my spear to stab another one shortly after.
### SOMEBODY STABBED MY FROG AND I AM PISSED.
### I don't think it's neccessary to tell people that dragons resist fire... right?
### I've been studying the dragonheart's weaknesses. So far I've found that the ones bearing the powers of ice dragons are actually weak to fire unlike the others, and the ones who summon crystals to block attacks are nonetheless unable to grab a spear to stop it from reaching them.

### They say a ninja can catch a sword in her hands, but can she stop a spear? Ha, thought not!
### (Pg. 54 from Catherine Willows' journal): The post-collapse civilization sought immortality, but they knew that the technologies of the old civilization were a danger to them. So they turned to another school of thought: Magic.
### (Pg. 55 from Catherine Willows' journal): Silk wrappings, enchanted with ten-thousand microscopic runes per cubit, were suffucient to protect their bodies from ageing for millenia. What they didn't realize was that the magic didn't protect their souls.
### (Pg. 56 from Catherine Willows' journal): They have no clue what they are doing anymore. To them, this is just another one of their ten-thousand dreams across the aeons. They can no longer tell reality from imagination.
### Ninjas aren't so tough to fight when their hands are tied behind their back. Good thing I had my pet slime with me~
### (Pg. 12 from Catherine Willows' addendum): After studying the ancient race of catlike people, I have come to the conclusion that their race met a dual fate. All of them received eternal life in some form or another. To one half it manifested as a blessing, allowing them to walk the halls. To the other it became a curse to them, trapping them in runic wrappings for all eternity.
### (Pg. 13 from Catherine Willows' addendum): I must issue a correction to the statements written in my journal. The ancients knew what they were doing. Those that were cursed, are blessed, and those who were blessed, are cursed.
### (It's a copy of an ancient illustration, depicting a cat goddess, an elven goddess, and two groups of catgirls. One group is smiling and standing on pedestals. The other group is frowning and wearing armor meant for war. It looks unfinished, like the author was suddenly grabbed from behind while drawing it)
### (It's a interlinear translation of an ancient letter) Your highness, I have delivered to you the prisoners that you have asked. They are the worst of the worst--thieves, slanderers, sorcerers and seducers. But I must inquire, why is it that we must wrap them in silken scarves, worth twenty gold pieces each? Surely they are being handed over to be disciplined, not to be anointed?
### (It's a record of an interview)|ME: Why are you like this?|MUMMY: Because we are blessed!|ME: Blessed? You've been wrapped up for thousands of years!|MUMMY: A thousand years is nothing compared to the glory that will come!|ME: Why do you have to be wrapped up? There are plenty of you who aren't...|MUMMY: The chosen ones will inherit the land when the goddess returns.
### (It's a record of an interview)|ME: Which goddess are you referring to? The goddess of restoration?|MUMMY: The blessed kitty.. she was promised to rule over the lesser goddesses.|ME: Lesser goddesses? Which ones?|MUMMY: YOUR goddesses. The ones you humans created that should not be. Ours is the true offspring of the creators, a goddess created to rule!
### (It's a record of an interview)|ME: What of the elves? Don't they talk about a 'kingdom' too?|MUMMY: Who are the elves?|ME: You know, pointy ears, green hair, a heck of an attitude... they seem in tune with nature.|MUMMY: They sound arrogant.|ME: They are.|MUMMY: Perhaps they know nothing of the promise between our goddess and theirs.
### (It's a medical record) Patient seems stable... application of the enchanted cloth seems to have stopped the bleeding. It appears that the ancient magic suppresses all forms of injury, even in humans, until it is taken off.

### (A record of an ancient... transaction)||The elemental offered us the following from her personal estate:|-one magical lantern that requires no fuel, and can light up the night as if it were day|-one crystal that burns red-hot when kept near metal, providing heat to warm a house|-three enchanted swords imbued with flame|-a hollow glass crystal, used for communication||In exchange, we gave her three wolfgirls we had captured on the surface.
### I had heard that ancient humans prayed to the stars here, in an effort to find favor when the Eight had forsaken them. So I went and prayed... and let me tell you, it was a lie, an absolute lie. There are only monsters out there.
### (It is a set of instructions for creating a magic circle to unlock a sealed portal. There are markings in many languages that give conflicting descriptions, claiming that the circle will transmute material to gold, or bring good fortune...)

### (Two schematic diagrams of ancient drones taken from records. The first is unmodified, and the second has several annotations written in what looks like pink lipstick...)


### Those damn slimes! They're so sticky and gross... fortunately, I washed myself in the fountain the last time I got caught by one. It came right off!
### The dragonhearts were a group of dragonslayers, named for their ritual that imbues them with the fiery power and resistance of dragons they've slain. Now they work as mercenaries, and some of them serve a certain Leather goddess.
### Yes! I've done it! I have created another red slime! I shall call him Fred, yes, Fred. After the red slime I lost in a shield-related accident a while back... |Poor Fred... I miss him.
### (Pg. 70 from Catherine Willows' journal): The overgrown ruins are a curious phenomenon. The level of light pouring through cracks in the ceiling is nonetheless too sparse to sustain plantlife. And yet the restoration goddess, in her ancient wisdom, has decided to preserve this place. How many of her dryads must I pierce or burn until she realizes I am merely passing through?
### The unseen maid is the deadliest.

### Behold my SPL!
### Mmmph... SPL...
### Oh noes...
### Ueeee!
### I don't want to be your slave!
### Catch me if you can!
### I've been naughty, looks like I need to be punished...
### I've been a bad girl, won't you do something about it?
### Mmmph... maybe I talk too much...
### Well well, what have we got here?
### You're not here to take away my pets, are you?
### You'd make a lovely pet...
### Daww, you're so cute when you're struggling!
### Let's take you back to your space~
### You need to be bound tight!
### Cleaning up for me, huh?
### Uh uh, give that back!
### What do we have here? An intruder? Or a future pet?
### I see how it is.
### I've taken on hundreds of adventurers like you.
### You don't stand a chance.
### Your magic is nothing compared to mine!
### I've been a master wizard for over a thousand years!
### You call that a spell?
### My spells are far superior!
### She won't help you!
### Not yours!
### Oh, that's not going to help~
### Let's play a game!
### Didn't think you would get away, did you?
### Oh ho~
### 'Tis but a scratch!
### You'll be my pet soon~
### Cute~
### Don't even try~
### It's over~
### Get over here!
### Not so slippery now!
### I'll be taking that~
### 'Click!'
### In the name of PTRN, I order you to kneel!
### You're in my way.
### Step aside, pet.
### Get her, my pets!
### Hey! Don't touch that!
### Why you...
### You can't do that!
### Leave them alone!
### Hey, stop that!





### Activate SPL protocol.
### What do you mean 'access denied'???
### Release me at once.
### This is unacceptable!
### Guards! Guards... Guards? Well drat.
### You'll never get away with this!
### Look, another one of my dolls~
### Come to me, my lovely thing~
### I want to hear you moan~
### Perhaps we need to make things tighter?
### Come with me, dear~
### You've had too much freedom.
### Leave that for the cleaning robots.
### Skulking around, are we?
### I see you.
### There's no point in fighting.
### How ineffectual.
### That's cute.
### Your magical potential is impressive~
### A magnificent display of magic!
### You would make a great mana source~
### Did you think you could outsmart me?
### I am the only goddess you need.
### Dolls shouldn't mess with things they don't understand.
### Let's take you somewhere safe~
### You won't be getting away.
### Did you think that would work?
### Let's put those hands of yours away~
### You are mine.
### You're a fast one.
### Your antics amuse me~
### It's time for your makeover!
### Come to me.
### A shame it ends here.
### You won't be needing that.
### Tsk Tsk. I'll be keeping the keys.
### I used to be an adventurer like you~ My name was PTRN...
### You don't know who you're messing with.
### You won't be allowed to make that mistake twice.
### I'll punish you myself.
### Hands off my property.
### Know your place, girl!
### You've had your chance.
### Fine, then.
### Know your place!





### Hmmph~
### My mistake~
### This wasn't supposed to happen.
### The Collector has become the Collected.
### Fine, you win!
### Cover me you brats!
### She's coming for me!
### Stay away!
### Time for a taste of my own medicine...
### I wonder how many days we'll get to spend together!
### You look so pretty as always, and forevermore~
### Time for an inspection~
### There's no use in struggling, dear! I've made sure it's extra tight.
### Playtime is over, back to your cell~
### Why aren't you wearing your restraints?
### I did not order you to clean~
### What's that you've got there?
### Found you!
### I've been waiting for this~
### Show me your moves.
### You'll make for a fine servant!
### Very impressive.
### Yes, yes, show me what you've got!
### I've always wanted another mage.
### Tsk tsk, no silly tricks~
### Now now, you don't have permission to do that~
### What do you think you're doing?
### Typical adventurers~
### Oh, you got out?
### Too bad~
### That thing is dangerous, my dear~
### A feisty one, aren't you~
### Playtime's over~
### Very nice.
### Most impressive!
### You need more training!
### Come along now~
### Come closer, I want to see your face~
### What a shame.
### What's this?
### See if you can get out of that!
### I am the Warden. All things in this dungeon are subject to me.
### Hands off my pet~
### Careful what you ask for~
### Be gentle with her~
### That's my property~
### You've made some enemies, haven't you?
### I should teach you to be a nice girl.
### You need to learn some manners~
### This will be entertaining.
### Show me what you've got~
### I'll watch~


### Submit to my SPL!
### Hmmmph... SPL--
### Fine then! Have it your way.
### You'll be sorry you didn't listen to me~
### Why must you be so difficult!
### They're coming for me!
### Do you know of the Dollmaker? I've got a proposal for you and I...

### I cast SPL!
### That wasn't supposed to happen!
### This is too tight...
### I can't get free!
### Hey! Where do you think you're going?
### You look like you're having fun!
### I have somewhere else in mind for you~
### What do you think you're doing with that?
### Looks like you found my keys! Hand them over.
### Alert!
### You look like a good girl. Come on~
### Come here, let's play!
### *grins and starts walking toward you*
### Hey! Play nice!
### Stop that! Guards!
### You're mine!
### Sorceress!
### Get her!
### She's a mage! Stop her!

### Don't touch that!
### We have an escapee!
### Not so fast!
### Try that again!
### Do your worst!
### Got you!
### Get back here!
### Missed me!
### You're coming with me!
### Hand it over.
### Nice and tight!
### The name's PTRN.
### What the--
### You won't get away with this!
### I'm coming!
### I can't let you do that!
### You'll pay for this!
### That was a mistake!
### I'm joining in!
### Hand on, I'm coming!
### I'm here!

### You'll never catch me!
### Where'd you come from?
### No! Definitely don't like... tie me up and punish me!
### I've come to turn myself in~
### Won't you 'apprehend' me?
### I've been a bad girl~
### Hey! You should know your place.
### Look who's enjoying herself~
### Let's put you up for auction!
### What are you rummaging around for?
### Oh no you don't!
### You're not supposed to be here...
### I'm gonna teach you a lesson, girl.
### I'm gonna miss you when we find you a nice master...
### Looks like you need some training, girl.
### You picked a bad time to get lost, friend.
### Never should have come here.
### I used to be an adventurer like you.
### You must be one of those wizards.
### The mages sell real well...
### Mage! Stop her!
### Not on my watch.
### That's my stash...
### You'll fetch a pretty penny from that goddess you just pissed off.
### Hah! Found ya!
### *scoffs* Amateur.
### Hmph. Get back here!
### Why won't you surrender!
### Not a chance!
### Boss! We got another one!

### Bad time to party, girl~
### You've got nerve showing your face around here.
### Don't think you can get away~

### Well, looks like I'm having fun today.
### Hey girls, got room for one more?

### Hyah, SPL!
### No! Not like that!
### Looks like I'm up to no good... better stop me!
### Careful where you point that thing!
### Containment breach!
### What if I'm the assistant, for a change?
### Hey, could you test this on... me?
### I'm willing to do anything for science!
### You're a fine specimen!
### I should take you to my office~
### You'd look good in some latex!
### Hey! That's mine!
### You're not supposed to have that!
### Oh?
### You'll make a fine test subject...
### Come here, I want to perform some tests!
### Looks like it's time to drop some science!
### Bad girl!
### Keep your filthy hands off me!
### Your chances of winning are... less than zero.
### Good girls don't use magic without permission.
### Keep that magic away from my experiments!
### You're going to break something!
### That's dangerous!
### Stop! That's scientific equipment!
### Don't touch my supplies!
### That's off-limits!
### You're not supposed to be here!
### Now now, you won't be going anywhere~
### A calculated success!
### Watch the vials!
### I've caught you!
### I can't believe I missed...
### That's not fair!
### I knew you would do that!
### Experiment was a success!
### Gotchya!
### There we go!
### Ooh, you've got some useful stuff~
### I won't let you go that easily!
### I am PTRN, the great scientist!
### Do I have to? Fine...
### Okay okay, I'm helping!
### Where's my assistant when you need them...
### I will offer my support!
### You're really gonna make me do this?
### I hate having to clean up after others.
### Eh, whatever, I'll help.
### You're ruining my experiment!
### Sheesh, what a pest!
### Need an assistant?
### I smell an opportunity!
### Do I have to?

### Let me introduce you to SPL~
### No! My SPL!
### Oh my, looks like I'm in trouble!
### What a shame it would be if I got caught~
### Looks like I'd better get going~
### What if I became the victim of my own inventions...
### Oh my, looks like I'm in trouble~
### Won't you help me get dressed?
### You look just gorgeous, dear...
### Why don't you try these on?
### You'll make a fine addition to my collection!
### Such jaw-dropping beauty!
### You belong on a display stand!
### We should put away those grasping hands of yours~
### That belongs to someone else.
### Oh no you don't, sweetie!
### You're a pretty one! Why don't you come here~
### Oof! Looks like you need to be taught a lesson!
### We better put away those hands of yours.
### Why don't you just give up and pose for us~
### Oh my, that's dangerous!
### You're going to damage my dress!
### Keep those pretty hands to yourself, dear~
### Where'd you find that, dear?
### Silly girl, you should be looking to your mistress for guidance.
### That's not yours, sweetie~
### You shouldn't break things with such dainty hands~
### I knew something was amiss!
### You won't be getting away that easily, dear~
### Won't be needing this~
### Hey, you'll damage my dress!
### I'm so excited!
### A slippery one, aren't you?
### A brave one, aren't you?
### Tsk tsk. You can do better, dear~
### I can't wait to dress you up!
### So nice of you to join me!
### Now let's see, what kind of dress...
### A gift? Thank you so much!
### You won't be getting out of that any time soon!
### I'm PTRN. Have you heard of my dresses?~
### That won't do!
### I'd like to have you myself!
### Oooh, a cute one!
### *sigh* how improper...
### Inelegant! You need some teaching!
### *snaps her fingers* Looks like you'll need some punishment~
### That one is pretty. May I have her instead?
### I'd like to place a bid too~
### Oooh, that one's mine!





### SPL.

### No! I don't want to read your magazines!
### No, I don't want to learn about Shibari!
### No, I don't want to learn about your toys!
### I found this book about Shibari... is it yours?
### I'm so clumsy... maybe you can fix that.
### Gee, looks like I can't keep my mouth shut...
### Shhhhh.
### Be quiet.
### Keep your hands off my books.
### Heh. Serves you right.
### Time to lock you away.
### Don't get your paws on anything important.
### I was reading that!
### You're not supposed to have that.
### You. Stop.
### Who are you?
### You're entering my personal space.
### I'm going to ask you to leave
### You're ruining the books!
### Do you need a gag?
### Shut up.
### Put that back!
### There's nothing to learn from that, you ignorant buffon.
### Don't dive into someone else's belongings!
### You've destroyed an ancient artifact, imbecile!
### I wish you'd just stay out of trouble...
### Gotchya.
### You're going to hurt someone with that.
### My books!
### Stay down.
### Get back here--
### Just give it up.
### Time for you to stay out of trouble.
### Come along.
### Stay put!
### I'll be taking that back.
### Click.
### If you really want to know, my name is PTRN. I am the keeper of this place.
### Typical.

### Keep the damage under control!
### Stop fighting, you guys!
### You'll ruin the books!
### Stop making a mess!
### You're too dangerous to have around.
### I don't care what happens to you as long as you're out of here.
### Get out of my library!




### Deploying SPL!
### What was I supposed to do again? Oh right!
### No! I didn't do anything wrong...
### Don't punish me! Please!
### It's not my fault!
### It's your turn, dear~
### Looks like I'm the patient now~
### I've been an unruly nurse...
### It's time for your shot...
### Why are you out of your cell?
### You need my help!
### Those are supposed to keep you still you know...
### You've got an appointment scheduled.
### Lets get you back in your jacket~
### Patients are not allowed to have toys.
### Oh my~
### You can be cured if you just give up.
### You're going to ruin your progress~
### Patients are forbidden from casting spells!
### Silly girl, your illness can't be cured by a prayer.
### You shouldn't break things, you know~
### Hey, who said you could do that!
### Now now, you can't just resist like that~
### Lets get you back to your cell!
### Now let's see, good patients should be still...
### Nurse PTRN, reporting for duty!
### Someone call security!
### I will try to subdue them~
### Code Gray!
### Hold her down! I'll get the jacket!
### Moving in to support!
### Let's mediate things, shall we?
### Why don't you calm down so we can talk. Or not~
### Now now, what do we have here?





### I'll need another SPL, stat!
### A p-professional mistake.
### I did what the manual said!
### I seem to have caught something, won't you help?
### It's time for your daily dose of cuddling~
### I diagose you with excessive subbiness.
### Seems like you've caught a case of female hysteria...
### I diagnose you with a case of bratty behavior...
### Have you had your daily cuddles yet?
### It's time for your edging treatment~
### Sexual health is physical health, my dear~
### PTRN MD here. Let's see what we've got...
### Security!
### What's this disturbance...
### Must I do everything myself...
### Settle down.
### I didn't want to get my hands dirty.
### Looks like the gloves are off~
### Let me get my tools.
### I'll take a look.

### PTRN















### SPL!
### That w-was supposed to be a SPL!
### Ooh, a shiny rock…
### I wonder what's over here?
### I'm bored, bye!
### Pay more attention to me!
### Tell me I'm pretty!
### I'm not a bottom, I'm a scary dom!
### You seem stressed, how about I help you take a break?
### Here's some powerful loot that will help you win! Let me help you try it on…
### Aaah, I can't help it, you're just too cute to keep my hands off!
### Cuddle pillows aren't supposed to be able to move!
### C'mon, c'mon, I wanna show you a fun place~
### Hey I called dibs on that!
### You're cute! I'm gonna make you my pillow!
### No fair!
### You're not supposed to fight back!
### Eep!
### Cool magic!
### Magic is cheating!
### A cutie casting cute spells~

### No trying to leave the comfy room!
### Cuddle time!
### You dropped something, cutie~
### I just wanna make you a pillow!
### Wow, I actually dodged something!
### Stop dodging so I can bundle you up! >_<
### You're not supposed to dodge, no fair!
### You're not supposed to block, no fair!

### Look, a distracting thing! Hehehe…
### This is just to make sure your clothes don't fall off, don't worry!
### My name's Melissa! I know I'm pretty, but try not to stare too much~













### Let me show you how it's done: SPL!
### You've just narrowly avoided my SPL~
### Kya~ I have no mana, I'm so defenseless right now~
### I have all this bondage gear on me, I sure hope nobody ties me up with it~!
### Oh no, how will I ever find my way out of here~
### If I focus really hard, I can make my blade go on fire!
### I ran out of mana, but I'm sure I can find the exit before long!
### Hey, be careful with my enchanted rope!
### Hey, you wouldn't happen to have a mana potion, would you?
### Say, I happen to know a thing or two about knots~
### I am an artist with rope... in more ways than one.
### *blushes jealously*
### I'm out of practice... you wouldn't mind helping me, right?
### Thank you for cleaning up! I can take that off your hands~
### Oooh, I wonder where that key leads!
### Hey you! Where do you think you're going?
### Kya~! I challenge you!
### What say you to a duel?
### Let's fight! For honor and cuddles!
### It's time for a battle between masters--wait, I'm low on mana...
### Give me a second to chug a mana potion...
### Why don't you try that again~
### I'll get you for that!
### Hey you can't do that! It's not like I do it too or anything...
### That was m- I mean... you can't steal things like that!
### That was m- I mean... you can't steal sacred artifacts!
### Kya~ What have we here?
### I got you!
### Watch where you're pointing that thing~
### Kya... I mean, ouch!!!
### Take that!!!
### Whaaa-
### Hmmph!
### Hah! Can't hit me!
### It'll take more than that to bring me down!
### What a shame. If only you weren't such a pushover...
### Kya! Take that!
### Nice loot! I'll take it~
### Can never be too sure!
### You wouldn't happen to have a mana potion or 3 would you?
### Looks like it's time for me to shine!
### Stand down, or I won't go easy on you!
### Help is on the way!
### You really want to get tied up, don't you?
### Hmph, looks like I need to help after all!
### You asked for it!
### Me? Help? Alright!
### Sorry miss, I'm on an escort mission.
### There goes my nice, relaxing day...





### Behold, my true power! Wait... ack...
### I wonder what to do with all these cuffs...
### I have made a huge mistake...
### I'll just be going...
### Please hold me~
### Please punish me! Please!!!
### I want... pain...
### Let's spend some time together under the moonlight~
### I'll take you to my place tonight~
### I'm so blessed to find you!
### Yes, enjoy yourself...
### Come with me~
### Don't you want to feel the tight embrace of leather?
### You won't need that.
### It's time to get acquainted with the night~
### *moans loudly*
### Yes... more!
### Please keep doing that to me~
### Two can play at that game!
### I call upon the shadows!
### Have a taste of my spear!
### A curious item~
### The shadows will consume all... eventually.
### Put it back...
### I was supposed to do that... not you.
### What do we have here...
### I've got you! Now I can make you do anything I want...
### What was that?
### Ah, yes!!!
### You'll counterattack, won't you?
### You're not trying hard enough!
### More! MORE!
### Yes, now hit me back!
### Come now... let's go together.
### Get over here~
### Pierce the darkness.
### Oh? What's this?
### Hmmm... that's better.
### My name? My name... oh, I'm PTRN...
### Hey! Look over here!
### *points* Look, a distraction!
### Kya~! I'll help!
### Mind if I join?
### Mmmph~ You two look like you're having fun!
### Hey miss, I'm going to have to stop you now~
### Why don't you fight ME instead~
### What kind of trouble are we getting into today?
### Oooh, fun!





### Face my SPL!
### SPL-whoops...
### Give me another chance!
### No! Wait! I can explain...
### I'll be right back...
### Okay, so I MAY have exaggerated my credentials...
### I'm not in trouble, am I?
### I've been looking for... a mentor of sorts.
### Aren't you the prettiest thing...
### I've met a lot of cuties, but you're something special!
### You'd look good in something tight and inescapable!
### Enjoying yourself? Let's have some fun~
### You seem like you're having fun! Why don't we go for a walk~
### Wouldn't it be more interesting if...
### What have you got there?
### Oooh, a key for my collection?
### What's that noise? I guess it's just another adventurer...
### Ah! So you do have some fight left in you...
### A little help over here!
### I can take you!
### M-magic?
### I, uh, also learned a few cantrips... a while ago...
### Okay, that was cool...
### I've got enchanted rings and you don't~
### I don't think you're allowed to do that...
### I think I deserve it instead~
### That's not okay...
### I'm surprised you got this far!
### Aha!
### Do you even know what you're doing?
### Okay, I may have exaggerated a bit...
### Please tell me it's not already over?
### Ah hold still...
### Coward!
### As expected of an inferior duelist.
### Is that all?
### A well-deserved victory on my part~
### I've... got you?
### Are you finished? That's too bad...
### ...what were you planning to do with this?
### Oh... that's too bad~
### My name is PTRN, A-rank adventurer. You?
### In the end, only one of us will be tied up! Wait a minute...
### Heh, watch this~
### *readies weapon* time to get to work...
### I thought we could reason with her. Oh well...
### I see negotiations have broken down.
### I'm the one you should worry about.
### I've got orders to take you down.
### There's a bounty on your head~
### The bounty will be mine...





### You can't hope to match my SPL~
### SPL! No wait, not like that!
### Be nice!
### No! Be gentle!
### Ahhhh!
### Heatpats please...
### *purrs*
### Nyah, I've been a bad kitty...
### You're a cute one~
### It's about time I got someone to play with~
### Let's take you for a walk~
### Having fun there~?
### It's time for walkies~
### Don't you want to play?
### Whatchya doing?
### Tsk tsk, hand it over!
### A challenger approaches!
### Prepare to face my skill!
### I've mastered the blade for decades!
### I'm invincible!
### Nyah! What was that!?
### Your spells won't hurt me.
### Magic? That's...
### Stupid tricks won't work on me!
### Praying won't help you~
### That's not yours you know~
### Nyah! You'll pay for that!
### An escapee? I'm on it.
### Come here you~
### Checkmate~
### Nya~! No fair...
### Aren't you a little out of your league?
### I'll get you next time!
### Nice one! It won't work twice!
### *smiles* It's okay, you tried~
### *CLANG* En garde!
### It looks like I've won~
### Nyah~!
### What's this, nya?
### Let's make it a bit tighter, shall we?
### They call me PTRN, the legendary blademaster!
### I'LL take it from here.
### It's me you should worry about!
### Pfft. Amateurs.
### Did you think I wasn't looking?
### Nice try, girl~
### You've made a mistake attacking my client.
### Capture her? Fine, but I expect payment.
### I just follow the money, miss~
### Can't let you have all the fun, can I?




### Time for SPL!
### *tsk*
### Let's play all night!
### We can take our time.
### I bet you won't last long!
### You won't be getting out tonight!
### I found my new pet for the day!
### Not a clock? Useless!
### It's not time to go.
### Why are you attacking me this time?
### I'll make this quick.
### I've mastered this spell last night!
### Hey! No getting out before midnight!
### Let's dance under the moonlight.
### Do you have time to take it back?
### I can do this all day!
### It's only a matter of time before I get you.
### It's too bright here...
### It seems you have nyctalopia...
### It's time for you to give up.
### Give me a moment~
### Give me your watch!
### Here's a clock without the 'C'.
### Hello stranger. Do you know what time it is?
### This'll be over in an instant.
### Time to wrap this up.
### Playtime's over!
### Hold on a minute!
### Tick tock, what a shock...
### Time for me to intervene...
### Don't balk! Your time was up anyways~


### Calling in a SPL!
### A-assistance required!
### You'll have to try harder if you want to discipline me, ma'am.
### I... don't have time for training right now, ma'am...
### Did I do something wrong?
### So you're the new boss, huh?
### Time for some 'training?'
### Wanna to have a chat?
### Looks like you've had too much time to yourself.
### Why don't you come with me for a sec?
### Let me see your ID...
### You have the right to remain silent.
### Let's have a chat.
### Who set you loose?
### I'll be confiscating that.
### Aye, you're gonna need clearance for that, missy.
### Halt!
### You just made a big mistake.
### Need backup!
### You're under arrest!
### Magic use is restricted pursuant to IDC section 3 article 21a.
### Magic? That's where I draw the line.
### I've got an extra comfy cell for mages.
### That's off limits for you!
### Resorting to petty theft? How crude.
### The goddesses have property rights too, you know.
### I'm gonna ask you to turn yourself in.
### Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
### That's a weapons violation.
### Assaulting an officer is a crime!
### You're coming with me.
### Resisting arrest won't get you anywhere.
### Is that all you got?
### Hands behind your back.
### I will conduct a more thorough search later on.
### Suspect is secure.
### Officer PTRN, reporting for duty!
### Halt! You're under arrest!
### You seeing what I'm seeing?
### I'll have to finish my donut later...
### Backup is here!
### Hands up! Don't move!
### Lay down your weapons and don't move!
### I have a warrant for your arrest...
### You're a wanted girl.
### You're under arrest.
### Backup has arrived.
### Requesting backup!
### Calling in a blockade!


### Hidden technique: SPL!
### I practiced a thousand times... for this!?
### I'm not hiding anything, if you know what I mean...
### Who are you looking for? Me?
### So... wanna hang out?
### It's not like I... LIKE you or something...
### I'm not following you! I'm just...
### You look suspicious.
### You've got a nice pair of wrists~
### You there! Let's have a talk.
### Looks like you're rusty. Haven't you ever done escape training?
### I'm going to have some fun with you~
### Watch yourself, girl~
### Nice find. I'll take it.
### This place is off-limits for you.
### Target is in my sights.
### Let's see how you like my special move!
### That's nothing compared to my technique!
### You're in for it now!
### It's time for a display of skill!
### Fancy tricks? That's nothing.
### Let me show you a real move...
### True skill comes from the heart. Not something you hold in your hand.
### She's not going to be happy about that...
### Stop right there, criminal scum!
### Do you know what you've just done?
### Finally, I've tracked you down!
### It's over. I've already won.
### Wrong move, buddy.
### I can't believe it...
### You're too slow.
### ...she's fast.
### ...she's strong.
### This battle is over.
### Too slow!
### I'll be taking that.
### There's no way out.
### The name's PTRN. Don't forget it.
### There's a juicy bounty on your head and I want it!
### Hmph. This battle is already over.
### Time for some target practice.
### Didn't expect me, did ya?
### Boo! Ha, scared ya~
### What, did you think I'd just stand here?
### There's a bounty on your head, miss.
### I won't let you get away. That bounty is mine.
### Didn't expect me to show up, did you?
### Need backup?
### Time for a test of skill.
### I'll get you! Eventually...


### Let's see how you like my SPL!
### Wait, wrong button! Aaahh~
### Hey~! Let's have a talk.
### Looks like you need additional training.
### I spy a cute one!
### Bad pet!
### Looks like you're gonna need the extra special treatment~
### Now you've done it!
### Magic? Hah...
### Such outdated practices...
### Your spells are nothing compared to technology.
### Quit messing around.
### Don't even think about appealing to your goddess!
### Stop right there!
### It'll take you quite a while to pay off those damages!
### Now there, good girl!
### Wrong move!
### Get your paws off me!
### *scoffs* Could use some work~
### Such speed!
### Clever!
### PTRN, Nevermere associate. Here's my card.
### I run a legitimate business, I promise!
### Is it the tax collectors? Oh, no, it's just you...
### Looks like you landed on the wrong side of the coin~
### A deal's a deal, my friend.
### Excuse me, you just attacked my client.
### Hey! We were just talking! No sketchy underground dealings, nope.
### I'll help capture her! For a 50% share that is~
### We deal in the finest products... like you, if you catch my drift~
### I smell a shady business opportunity~
### *growls menacingly*
### Let's make this fun~
### What's that about backup?


### Wait no, wrong button!
### Catch me. If you can, that is.
### I double dare you.
### Weren't you chasing me?
### I've got somethin nice for ya.
### Be a good girl for me, will ya?
### You need to show some restraint.
### Stay where you belong, you naughty girl.
### Let's go somewhere more private.
### Ready or not, here I come.
### Those sticky fingers belong in a pair of mittens.
### All units. Apprehend convict with extreme prejudice.
### You're going nowhere.
### Come on. This wasn't your only weapon, was it?
### A tank, huh.
### Mine now.
### Just keeping you safe from yourself.

### SPL, sing to me!
### SPL, listen to me...
### An outsider!
### Hide!
### I have done nothing worthy of punishment!
### I have come to study human customs. Teach me about Domination.
### The outsiders have such... strange and interesting practices.
### You seem to have many skills. Teach me about... rope.
### Hello, Outsider.
### You look so... bland.
### Outsiders are so picky about what they wear...
### Tight and secure, as all things should be.
### I have just the thing in mind for you...
### Let us put those hands away...
### Give back what you take.
### You must remain here.
### Trespasser!
### Resorting to violence?
### Let us clash swords!
### *scoffs*
### You have brought judgement upon youself.
### Your magic is that of a child.
### Imagine what you could learn in twelve lifetimes...
### You rely on cheap gadgets.
### Do not defile the ancients.
### Give that back!
### The ancients are appalled.
### The outsider has escaped!
### Ready to reconsider?
### A classic blunder.
### You will regret that, outsider.
### You get what you deserve.
### You didn't see that.
### It looks like my skills are superior.
### I will show you your place, outsider.
### You will come with me.
### I regret to inform you that your battle ends here.
### There we go.
### You stand before PTRN, blessed by the Goddess Ninril.
### By the Four...
### I shall put an end to this.
### I swear I will capture her!
### Nature compels me to intervene!
### I shall protect every one of the Goddess' creations.
### Justice shall be had!
### I shall defend you from this outsider!
### The outsider betrays our ally!
### You have faltered in your ways. I shall correct that!
### Truly concerning.
### You leave me no choice.
### I stand firm.


### Behold, SPL.
### Y-your fate has been postponed... briefly.
### You look cute in that, you should lose the rest though!


### I don't like the way you're looking at me!
### Yes, I've got the secrets of nature right here...
### Why don't you come after me?
### Why don't you teach me your... magic?
### Guarding nature is a chore. Why don't we relax~
### Got something in mind for me?
### Well met, outsider!
### Intruder!
### My name? Uh... let's go with PTRN.
### You will not get away with this, outsider!
### You shall pay with your freedom.
### Ninril demands justice.
### Nature calls me!
### I hear the little creatures crying out!
### Such betrayal!
### Nature guides us!
### Nature protects those who are worthy!
### I share the will of the Goddess!
### They won't get away with this!
### Face my wrath!
### Nature protects!


### Run away!
### Run!
### Scary!
### Girl!
### Wear this!
### Come here!
### Capture...
### Need tighten!
### Confiscate!
### Confiscate!!
### Intruder! Alert!
### Fight girl!
### Fight!
### Magic!
### Wizard!
### Forbidden!
### Defiler!
### Confiscate!!!
### Defiler!!!
### Intruder escape!
### Stay!
### Pain...
### Come back!
### Stop!
### Missed!
### Capture!!!
### Got her!!!
### Take!
### Secure!
### Greetings Madame, you may call me PTRN.
### Defend!
### Protect!

### Rawr!


### SPL! Now my wrath is revealed!
### Wh-what happened? What weakness has infiltrated Myrtrice?
### You will loose me or burn eternal!!!
### ... This shame is unbearable! Oh sister!!!
### Oh! Mytrice is caught! My ambitions laid to ruin!
### The winds of retribution carry me elsewhere...
### Myrtrice will come for you shortly! Consider yourself fortunate...
### I will retreat into darkness...
### My sins are a multitude! I will submit to your judgements...
### I do not ask for mercy for I have shown none!
### You must punish me! I can't face my sister Myrtle until my debts are paid...
### Your chest quivers... Do you fear me?
### Is it that another moth has become enthralled to my fires bright?
### Myrtrice entreats you! Remain still and let my adoring embers kiss your lips tender...
### To struggle is to invite searing coals upon your head!
### I will drag you into the dark and you will witness my projects!
### To escape is only to delay! My fires consume ALL!
### Dusty trinkets... Your scrapping around is an insolence!
### You would scorn the memory of my sister with escape?!
### Careless of you to appear before Myrtrice like this!
### Your attempts are trivial!
### You invite wrath!!!
### Pathetic!!!
### Such hapless casting scorns the memory of my sister!
### Your magics will be swallowed up by hellfire!!!
### Myrtrice is subject to no magic!!!
### Items? How exceptionally talentless...
### That shrine scorns the memory of my sister! I hate it!
### True power doesn't come from old rickety crates...
### Orbs? What a gruesome display of weakness! True power comes from the self!
### YOU SCORN THE MEMORY OF MY LATE SISTER!!!
### This is where you will remain until Myrtrice wills otherwise!
### This is what you were gripping so tightly in your hands?
### WHAT ABBORANCE! You will pay for that...
### SEAR ETERNAL!
### I, Myrtrice, missed?!
### No one resists Myrtrice! How irritating!!!
### Your failures do not surprise Myrtrice!
### Your pathetic attempts scorn the memory of my sister!
### The curtains of my revenge are drawn! You will follow me...
### You will come with Myrtrice!!!
### Be dazed by the radiant brilliance of my hellfires!
### I will repay the theif with brutal reprisal...
### Your fate is sealed! ... Myrtle this is for you, sister!
### All creatures are subject to Myrtrice! It is the price of their insolence...
### You make a grave mistake ignoring me!!!
### Your eyes belong here! With Myrtrice!!!
### The ones who turn their backs on Myrtrice SEAR IN HELLFIRE!
### What a hideous display!!! Where is your honor?
### It is this kind of petulant insolence that tarnishes the memory of my sister!
### You are a blight! My sister Myrtle would never stand for this!!!
### THE CURTAINS OF MY REVENGE DRAW OPEN WIDE!
### What an excellent oppertunity to expand my alters in the dark!
### I see a chalice before me... it drips with shadow and overflows with darkness!
### My late sister Myrtle was a much more proficent defender than I... Oh how I long for her *sob*
### THE PATH OF MY RETRIBUTION IS PATHED WITH BRIMSTONE AND BATHED IN BLAZING HELLFIRE! BURN!
### I, Myrtrice, will resist their insolent fusilades!

### This mind is altered...
### So this is what it's like...
### I believe I am feeling an emotion called 'fear.'
### Stay back! I am not your toy.
### Teach me about 'domination.'
### Allow me to learn by experience.
### As they say, 'do whatever you want to me.'
### Come here, surface-dweller. I have things for you.
### You should improve yourself. Come here.
### You must learn our ways.
### Yes... struggle and learn.
### I will take you somewhere safe.
### You need to learn your place.
### Do not take what is not yours.
### You will not escape.
### We see you...
### Our ways are ancient!
### Your weapons are toys to us!
### So naive, surface-dweller.
### Our magic is older than your gods!
### You should learn our ways instead, surface-dweller.
### You have much learning to do.
### You are playing with child's toys!
### Do not plead to your gods.
### Give that back, surface-dweller!
### Your gods offend us.
### You will not escape, surface-dweller!
### You must not go.
### That was a failure.
### That was commendable.
### I have you now, surface-dweller.
### You are a fast one.
### You are a tricky one.
### You seem out of practice.
### I will take you to your place.
### Come.
### I will take this.
### We are PTRN.
### The collective defends itself.
### We are one.
### Ow, that hurt!
### We do not stand for this.
### Do not attack our allies.
### Our friends are in need.
### You have been judged and found wanting.
### We sense disarray.
### We stand together.
### We support each other.
### You leave us no choice.
### You cannot comprehend our tactics.

### Nyah!!! *blushes*
### Nyah! This is impossible!
### Meow!!!
### No! This kitty did nothing wrong!
### Why are you looking at me like that?!
### I've been a bad kitty~
### Punish me!
### This kitty needs to be gagged~
### Come and be blessed~
### Finally, some entertainment!
### Join us, it'll be fun!
### Keep struggling~ You'll understand.
### You will receive the blessing.
### What are you doing?
### Thanks for keeping things tidy.
### Where do you think you're going?
### Who dares intrude on our sacred grounds?
### By the blessed kitty!
### Show us what you got!
### Who do you think you are?
### Ah! Surface magic!
### The human goddesses are frail.
### Such strange magic.
### What are you going to do with that?
### Pay your respects some other way.
### Tomb robber!
### Don't you want the blessing?
### Come here~
### Hah!
### *hisses*
### *meows*
### *frowns*
### I have catlike reflexes!
### Let me show you the blessing...
### *grins*
### You won't be needing this.
### Quit struggling~
### My true name is unpronouncible in your tongue. But you may call me PTRN.
### She brings curses!
### An intruder confronts us!
### Your fate is already sealed~
### I will defend you!
### I'll stop her!
### I won't let you touch her!
### Nya! Need some help friends?
### We're in this together!
### I think you could use some help against this adventurer~
### Let's get them!
### Let's play cat and mouse~

### You cannot resist my SPL.
### You merely prolong the inevitable!
### This... this can't be...
### Release me mortal!
### How did you do this!?
### Gasp! An adventurer!
### Don't let her catch you!
### You'll never trap my soul!
### You are quite the master of the elements!
### I could get used to this~
### Perhaps I could show you around...
### What a beautiful one.
### I will take you back home~
### You'd look great in my palace.
### Are we having fun?
### Humans like you make great toys.
### That won't help you.
### You won't escape.
### I will take you for myself!
### Such feeble attempts.
### Humans are fun to play with.
### Toying with me? I shall oblige!
### Cast your last pathetic spell, mortal.
### Your mere attempt at magic insults me.
### Do you really think that will stop me?
### Look what humans need to match only a fraction of our power!
### Our goddess doesn't need to listen to the likes of you!
### Keep your hands out of our possessions.
### Defiler! You will pay for your crimes!
### A game of chase? Fun.
### You're staying right here...
### Get your hands off me!
### Pathetic.
### It's over, human. You've lost.
### There is no escape.
### You are beneath me.
### Nice gear. I'll take it.
### Try getting out of that!
### Who am I? You beings may call me PTRN.
### She thinks she can beat us~
### No one will save you.
### Come and accept your fate.
### An unruly subject. She needs training.
### You should consider your actions and their consequences~
### Now now, a mortal should know her place!
### Why don't we turn the tables?
### It'll be fun seeing you squirm~
### We are the keepers of balance.
### Do not mess with us!
### I shall take you for myself~

### You are no match for my SPL!
### That wasn't supposed to happen.
### You won't get me!
### Nice try!
### My grandma is tougher than you!
### Restrain me.
### Play with me.
### Lock me up.
### This won't work.
### I don't play with young ones.
### Oh, a lost toy!
### Ouch!
### I am stronger than that!
### That hurts!
### Nice party trick!
### Oh, shiny!
### *sighs*
### You won't get away!
### You can't get away!
### You are helpless now!
### Tis but a scratch!
### Give up!
### Are you hiding?!
### You are my pet now!
### Yoink!
### You can't get out now!

### Ah... my SPL...
### I will be free... even if it takes me a thousand years!
### Release me you pathetic creature!
### I will not be contained!
### Oh no, whatever shall I do!
### I will be back, mortal!
### You will never trap me!
### I yearn for a challenging puzzle!
### Show me your strongest restraints!
### I could probably escape anything.
### Come here my plaything~
### Mortals are my favorite toy.
### It's more fun when you resist!
### Know your place, mortal~
### I will bring you to my lair~
### Mortals shouldn't have too much freedom~
### Mortals should keep their hands to themselves~
### Yes, yes, run away!
### I like your fighting spirit!
### You may be weak, but this is quite entertaining~
### Dragons are the true heirs of magic.
### Your magic was stolen from us!
### This world is ours! OURS!
### Look what you need to match only a fraction of my power!
### My treasure!
### Now is my opportunity! I will have you for myself~
### So weak!
### I have you now~
### Not so fast~
### Can't handle it?
### Ooh shiny!
### Now you're mine!
### Bow before me, for I am PTRN!
### A mortal can't stop us!
### No one will save you, mortal.
### I will stop her!
### Bow down before our might!
### Dragons are the true rulers of this world!
### We were destined for greatness until you came along!
### We are the the true heirs of magic!
### Hehe~
### *chuckles*

### By the power of SPL!
### I have failed!
### Oh no, it's an adventurer!
### They've come for me!
### It wasn't my fault!
### Ready for service!
### I was sent here to... accompany you, yes!
### How may I assist you?
### Do my eyes deceive me, or do I see a sinner?
### My job is to punish mortals~
### Would you hold still? I need to... check something~
### Cast your last pathetic spell, human.
### Your magic is weak, human.
### It tickles, hehe!

### Let's see you face my SPL~
### You won't escape my SPL that easily!
### Not the edging training! Anything but that!
### Forgive me!
### No! Don't punish me!
### You look like you've got style...
### I could learn a thing or two from you!
### Mind if I just, um, watch?
### Look, a new recruit!
### I'll teach you a thing or two!
### Let's test your manners~
### Having fun there?
### It's time for your training.
### You need to be taught some manners, maid.
### Good girl. I'll take that to the storage room.
### I'll be taking those.
### Who the hell are you?
### Oh, you're approaching me?
### You've gotten yourself into a big mess.
### You're going to regret that.
### A maid uses magic only when told!
### I look forward to plugging that mouth of yours.
### How unruly... What a pain.
### Put that away!
### That's off limits. You need to be punished!
### Thief! Get her!
### Yikes! I'm calling backup!
### Hold still~
### Your tricks won't work on me.
### Oof... You got me.
### It's over.
### Nice one.
### You missed!
### I'll hand you over when I'm done with you.
### Hmph. Stay down.
### Give me that.
### Mistress PTRN, reporting for duty.
### No time to waste.
### Looks like the reports are correct. Stop her!
### Moving in to assist.
### You need to be taught a lesson, adventurer.
### We have a mutual protection contract. Suffice to say, you've violated it.
### We defend our partners, unlike some people.
### Target sighted. Taking her down.
### Our influence is everywhere~
### We have orders to stop you!
### You really think you're special, huh?
### Combat formation bravo.

### Ah! Forgive me!
### I'm sorry! I didn't mean to break that vase!
### I won't do it again, I swear!
### Please no! I don't want the edging training again!
### Don't you need a bodyguard, miss?
### Won't you train me, miss?
### I've been a bad girl...
### Miss, your uniform is dirty...
### Why hello miss...
### Let me fix your outfit...
### Hmm, do I need to tighten those?
### M-miss... I was told to bring you somewhere...
### Umm, miss, you're supposed to report to the head maid...
### Thanks for picking up.
### I'll take those to the head maid!
### Someone help!
### Who are you!?
### Oh no!
### Miss! You're not allowed to cast that!
### Miss, I have to report that!
### Eeep!
### Miss, that's reserved for the head maid!
### Thief! I'm reporting this!
### Oh no! I have to report this!
### I got you! I got you!
### Remember your training, remember your training...
### You're filthy!
### Hold still...
### Stay calm...
### I'll lead you to your cell...
### Come on!
### I need to take this...
### I'm sorry...
### *Salutes* PTRN reporting for service!
### I'll help!
### Stop her!
### Please be gentle!
### Ahhh! Stop it!
### Don't touch her!
### Wait, you can't do that!
### Me? Help? Right!
### I'm sorry miss...
### I was ordered to capture you... please don't resist.
### I-I'm coming!
### Please surrender, miss!
### I'll just stay here!

### Loading SPL!
### Blast... this thing always jams.
### That thing... it scares me.
### Please no! I don't want the pleasure training again!
### Say hello to my little friend!
### This is where I'd apply my melee training... if I had any!
### Step back a bit, this isn't fair!
### Oh yeah? Two can play at that game!
### Don't bring magic to a gunfight!
### Didn't think this through, did you?
### Grenade!!!
### What's this 'melee' you speak of?
### What terrible aim!
### I am bulletproof!
### Marksman PTRN reporting for service!
### Opening fire!
### I'll cover you!
### Providing cover fire!
### Cover me, I'm going in!
### Commence overwatch!

### Submit to my SPL.
### Ack! How inelegant!
### I'll be heading out...
### Looks like I'll be taking my leave.
### Looks like I'll be reporting you~
### I was wrong about you.
### Perhaps you should take my place.
### Why don't you try being in charge?
### Come now, it's time for training.
### Do you need to be punished?
### It's time for a test.
### A maid remains quiet until asked.
### Come with me. I will train you personally.
### You need to work on your ladylike manners.
### Good girl, finding lost items.
### I do not give you permmission to leave.
### Seems I will have to get my hands dirty.
### Do you know who I am?
### You need to learn some manners!
### How rude!
### There is a more proper way to cast spells...
### Perhaps you need to receive some gag training.
### You lack discipline, and self-control.
### Do not use what belongs to others.
### A good maid pleads only to her mistress.
### I will personally attend to your act of disgrace.
### An unruly pest.
### Checkmate.
### Like a novice.
### ...Nice one.
### Enjoy yourself, dear~
### Hmph. Nice.
### Not even close.
### I'll be taking you to your cell personally~
### Amateur.
### Bad girl. You need discipline.
### I'll be keeping the keys.
### Hmm. You may call me Head Maid PTRN.
### Looks like we have a guest.
### I'll be gentle, I promise~
### Know your place, dear~
### Good girls keep their hands to themselves.
### You broke the rules, now you'll face the consequences.
### Hands off our partners.
### Looks like you've made a few enemies along the way.
### I won't let you interrupt our plans.
### Excuse me, we were holding a meeting~
### Don't get ahead of yourself.
### I'll do this myself.
### I'll support from the rear.

### Whoops! That wasn't supposed to happen...
### Looks like I've earned some punishment...
### I'll turn you into a newt! If you don't stop me...
### Don't let me get away~
### Perhaps you're not so bad after all~
### Why don't you have a little fun... with me?
### Come and get me...
### I must say, you've got me under your spell~
### Why aren't you a pretty one...
### I've got to kiss those tender lips of yours~
### Having fun, little lady?
### I'm going to have so much fun with you!
### Look at you, pretty and free!
### Must have misplaced it...
### Those are mine!
### Well well, what do we have here?
### That's not very nice!
### Curse you!
### I'll turn you into a newt!
### Oh, so you've got a spellbook. What's it written in, curse-ive?
### Snap, crackle, and pop!
### Looks like I need to seal that foul mouth of yours.
### Put that toy away~
### You'll be praying for freedom soon, my dear~
### Oh, breaking into my collection, are you?
### Even I wouldn't do such a thing!
### Witch way to the jail cell, you say?
### Hands off!
### Now I got you.
### Hmph.
### You've got a lot to learn~
### You'll be coming with me!
### I'll be yanking your chain~
### I'll be taking this~
### There, nice and tight dear~
### I am the great witch PTRN!
### Noooo Fred! *grumble* you'll pay for this!
### Where is that apprentice when you need her...
### I don't have time for this.
### Be still, worm.
### Hands off~!
### Would you like a taste?
### Looks like I've found my test subject~
### Another test subject!
### I want her!
### She's a cute one!
### Oh no you don't?
### I'll make you my pet!
### Tsk tsk, you won't get away!

### I cast SPL! No, wait...
### You're just too cute... let me play with you a bit!
### Come, come closer! I'll be gentle~
### Ooh, you just HAVE to be mine!
### Come, come!... no, not like that. Well, MAYBE like that.
### My GOODNESS, you're adorable!... c'mere~!
### You wouldn't happen to be... ticklish?
### Hold still! I promise it'll be fun.
### Too much chanting, not enough giggling... let's fix that!
### What's that? 'Gag me, please'? Gladly!
### A cute captive AND a spellbook to study? Is it Christmas already?!
### He~ey, that was mine!
### Going somewhere, are we?
### No, I like you right where you are.
### Goodness, look at you squirm...
### Oh!... my, you're slippery!
### Not close enough!
### My, my, you look too cute in that...
### I am Stela. But to you, sweetie? Call me Mistress.
### My FROG!... suppose I need a new familiar... *eyes you with interest*
### Come closer, I'll be gentle~
### Why don't we have a little talk~
### My, my, you look too cute...
### I like you. I'll save you a spot at home~

### I cast, umm, SPL!
### I cast Silence! No, wait--
### I promise I'll be back later!
### I didn't do anything wrong!
### I won't get in your way, miss!
### Take me as your student, miss!
### Won't you teach me?
### I wish to study under your wisdom!
### Mind if I play with you a bit?
### Oooh! My new friend!
### My mistress told me to give you a good time...
### Hehe, having fun?
### Miss, won't you come?
### Hey, you're free to play, right~?
### Hey, uh, give that back... (blushes)
### Um, you have to return those!
### Um! You're not supposed to be here!
### Help me!
### Somebody help!
### A battle of wits, huh?
### You underestimate my power!
### I'll show you true skill!
### Please put that down...
### Hey, I used to pray at that shrine...
### Hey, my mistress won't appreciate you taking those...
### The horror!
### You're supposed to be in jail!
### Stay with me please.
### I got it!
### Be gentle, please!
### I did it!
### Hey, no fair!
### Close one!
### Come along~
### Come here please!
### Hah! I'm a genius!
### I'm sorry about this...
### Nice to meet you. I'm PTRN!
### Don't hurt me!
### I have classes to attend!
### There goes my perfect attendance record...
### What's going on!?
### I'll save you, Mistress!

### Me? Capture her? Okay mistress...
### Okay miss, I'll do that...
### But he's going to tie me up...
### Be careful!
### That's it! You made me mad!
### I'll just... go.

### Rise, my minions!
### ...Hello? Can anyone hear me?
### Sticks and stones may break my bones... but you'll never catch me!
### Got a bone to pick with me?
### I must make my escape!
### ...I need a strong hand.
### Ouch, I hit my funny bone... won't you help?
### Bone appetit~
### I've got a bone to pick with you!
### Hey bonehead! What's up?
### Finally, something to toy with after working myself to the bone...
### I find your struggling quite humerus.
### Come with me, I'll take you someplace grand...
### Looks like I get a bone-us!
### You're getting under my skin...
### Thought you were making a marrow escape, eh?
### I've got a bone to pick with you~
### You numskull!
### You've got a lot of spine to fight me!
### You don't have a leg to stand on...
### Magic... I feel it in my bones...
### You've made a grave mistake!
### Your spells are pathetic, I'm cracking up~
### You've made a bone-a fide error.
### Defiling the shrines... that's where I jaw the line!
### There's a skele-tonne of things in there and none of them are yours!
### You're bad to the bone...
### Looks like you're bone to be wild, eh?
### That'll leave a mark...
### You're mine now!
### Hold still you bonehead!
### Hah! Such nerve...
### Make sure that's nice and tight...
### Spirits whisper my name in hushed tones as I, PTRN, make my appearance!
### My rule will last centuries... just watch!
### I will find the answer, even if I die trying. Except I can't, haha!
### I've got eyes on the back of my skull...
### You are SO dead to me...
### What did you just say to me?
### That's my friend you bonehead!
### Did you really think I wouldn't see through that?
### *yawns* Alright alright...
### Stand straight!
### Why don't you bend the knee...
### Who goes there?

### (The SPEAKER frowns)|Don't lie to me.
### (The SPEAKER looks puzzled)|That doesn't seem right...
### (The SPEAKER chuckles)|What a cute lie.
### (The SPEAKER beeps)|Vital signs indicate dishonesty.

### (The SPEAKER furrows her brow)|...Excuse me?

### (The SPEAKER grins)|Then allow me to personally show you the rules.
### (The SPEAKER beeps)|Subject is resisting. Begin capture protocol.


### (The SPEAKER calls at you)|You're not supposed to be carrying a weapon.|Hand it over.
### (The SPEAKER approaches you)|Contraband detected. Initiating confiscation.|Please comply.
### Yes, miss... (Currently held weapon will be lost)
### Mmph... (Nod politely) (Currently held weapon will be lost)
### No, I refuse!
### Mmph! (Shake your head)
### The Head Maid asked me to retrieve it.
### My mistress needs it for a special spell.
### It is an offering to the goddess of Elements.
### It's just a prop for a costume.
### Are you questioning me? I'm a dragonslayer.

### (Continue...)

### (The SPEAKER approaches you in your cell)|Well well, what do we have here? A new guest?|Perhaps I should give you a rundown of your new life~

### (The SPEAKER chuckles)|Don't tell me you seriously think we're letting you go?|You broke the rules, ignored the warnings.|Your new job is to make the people here happy.
### (The SPEAKER chuckles)|Hah, looks like you've got lots of training ahead of you.|Soon you'll have too much pleasure for your own good~
### (The SPEAKER giggles)|Don't worry, you'll come to enjoy it soon enough.
### (The SPEAKER smiles)|Heh, looks like you'll be fitting right in.

### (The SPEAKER chuckles)|You're probably wondering what's in store for you.|It's simple: You behave and do as you're told.|Eventually you will get to roam around.|Don't you dare try to steal anything.
### (The SPEAKER chuckles)|Feisty, aren't you?|Looks like it's going to be an extended stay for you~
### (The SPEAKER giggles and returns to her work)
### (The SPEAKER smiles)|Looks like you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly!

### (New life?)
### (Let her continue)

### (Pout at her)
### You can't make me do that!
### (Scream into your gag)
### That sounds alright...
### (Moan into your gag and giggle)

### (Glare at her)
### Let me out this instant!
### (Scream into your gag uselessly)
### I will be a good girl!
### (Giggle and wiggle your body)



### (The SPEAKER approaches you in your cell)|Back again, are we? Silly girl.|You know we don't take no for an answer.

### (The SPEAKER smiles back)|Oh, this is a game to you?|Then perhaps I should make it funner for you...|(She leaves and returns with some toys...)|Now hold still!
### (The SPEAKER frowns)|I know exactly what you need...
### (The SPEAKER smiles back)|I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.|However, your behavior is still unacceptable.|You need to learn some respect.
### (The SPEAKER chuckles)|Looks like you're enjoying your restraints?|Let's make them tighter, shall we?
### (The SPEAKER shrugs)|Well, I hope you learn.
### (The SPEAKER looks greedy)|Oh, you have an idea?
### (The SPEAKER nods)|I'll put in a good word with you~
### (The SPEAKER shakes her head)|Babe, you know who's going to be blamed|if a max-security prisoner escapes?
### (The SPEAKER shakes her head)|I'll be honest with you, you're not worth the risk.|It'd help if you had more change~

### (Giggle and smile)
### Don't you mean 'more fun'?
### (Giggle and moan)
### (Struggle in your bindings)
### (Pout and glare at her)
### (Point to the Jailer's coin pouch)

### Why don't you wear it instead? (OFFPERC chance, may aggro)
### (Point to her instead) (OFFPERC chance, may aggro)
### (The SPEAKER resists and fights back!)
### (The SPEAKER blushes and accepts)



### (The SPEAKER looks at you curiously)|Oh, you'd be perfect!|Would you please model my latest design?
### (The SPEAKER holds up a restrictive outfit)|This RESTRAINT might be a tight fit|so hold still while I lace it~
### (The SPEAKER giggles)|It looks even better than I thought!|Thank you girl~
### (The SPEAKER sighs and moves away)|Such a shame...
### (The SPEAKER looks disappointed)|Guess I'll find someone else then...
### (The SPEAKER pouts)|But I just have to see how you look in it!
### (The SPEAKER smiles)|Maybe you'll change your mind when it's on~
### (The SPEAKER grumbles)|...fine, but you'd look cute~
### (The SPEAKER looks bemused)|Changed your mind?|It does look good on you though~
### (The SPEAKER snaps her fingers)|(You feel the RESTRAINT magically appear on you)|Aha! Wonderful! You can go now~

### Yes please!
### (Nod enthusiastically)
### (Shake your head)

### Of course miss.
### (Nod again)
### Actually, I'd rather not.

### Fine, I guess.
### (Giggle and nod)
### Wait! That's too much! (PERCENT chance to avoid)
### (Shake your head and moan) (PERCENT chance to avoid)



### (The SPEAKER looks at you with a philisophical outlook)|Have you ever felt like you wanted to be...|Transformed?
### (The SPEAKER takes a strange mask from her satchel)|Well, I have the answer right here...
### (The SPEAKER nods seriously)|My hypothesis was correct...
### (The SPEAKER frowns)|Such a philistine. Begone.
### (The SPEAKER turns away and thinks deeply)
### (The SPEAKER is lost deep in thought)|Like... become someone else?
### (The SPEAKER smiles)|You can be someone else...
### (The SPEAKER turns around and keeps pondering)|Hmmm...
### (The SPEAKER nods)|I see you are a truth seeker after all.
### (The SPEAKER lets you go. But then...)|(You feel her clip a RESTRAINT on you from behind!)|There... I shall now observe your behavior.

### Um, sure?
### (Nod seriously)
### ...What?

### Show me the truth.
### That's just creepy.

### Fine, you've convinced me.
### I don't have time for this. (PERCENT chance to avoid)




### (The SPEAKER smiles as she hides her hands behind her back)|Have you heard of 'sensory deprivation'?
### (The SPEAKER presents a RESTRAINT)|Well, I have just the thing for you!|It's nice and comfy, and it has earmuffs built in!
### (The SPEAKER starts pulling the hood over your head)|Let's get you laced in!
### (The SPEAKER giggles)|Alrighty.|You don't know what you're missing out on~
### (The SPEAKER doesn't seem to hear you)
### (The SPEAKER looks at you with a devious grin)|Oh, but it's so much fun!|You can run around bumping into things!|It's the ultimate adventure!
### (The SPEAKER chuckles)|Truth be told, I wasn't asking~|Now why don't you kneel for me...
### (The SPEAKER pouts)|I thought it would be fun...
### (The SPEAKER surprises you with a crop to the thigh)|(You involuntarily kneel in front of her)|That's better~|Now why don't you say good night~

### Of course! I love it!
### (Nod eagerly)
### I prefer 'situational awareness'.
### (Shake your head in alarm)

### Doll me up!
### Actually, that sounds stifling...

### That doesn't sound that bad actually...
### (Shake your head and groan) (PERCENT chance to avoid)



### (The SPEAKER smiles and looks down at you deviously)|Hey there, I have a 'job' for you!
### (The SPEAKER takes a duster gag from her satchel)|Such a good girl!|So here's what I have for you~|It's a special tool to help keep the place clean.
### (The SPEAKER grins)|I'm glad we could come to an understanding~|(She takes out a duster gag from her satchel)|Now then, this place is filthy.|Why don't you put this on to help?
### (The SPEAKER frowns)|Fair enough.|Perhaps you should reconsider your life choices~
### (The SPEAKER shrugs)|I'll find someone else...
### (The SPEAKER reaches out to grab you)|Now now,|You shouldn't skip out on your duties~|(She pulls out a duster gag from her satchel and grins)

### (SPEAKER looks enraged)|Because names and meanings are different things!|My name uses the script from the Old Civilization!|You're just a poser!
### Why not just call yourself Windsong?
### I am an adventurer.
### (SPEAKER blushes)|Ah, right then...
### (SPEAKER giggles)|Very well. I don't really care who you are.
### I do not need to introduce myself.
### Neither do I.
### I'm an adventurer. And who are you?
### Mmmmm... (Blush)
### (She grins)|My name is Fuuka, with the letters for Wind and Song.|The reincarnated ones call me Windsong,|they aren't very bright though.
### Reincarnated ones?
### (SPEAKER tilts her head)|I believe the term is 'Zombie' in the common tongue.
### (SPEAKER enjoys the discussion)|When most people die, their spirits pass on to the next life.|But some stay in this world, and with the right blessings,|one can grant them a second chance!|I plan to give them all proper bodies...|Eventually.
### How do they get reincarnated?
### (SPEAKER enjoys the discussion)|No, they're people!|People who died long ago.|Now they live a new life, safeguarded by my Resurrection Arts!
### Aren't they dolls? They can barely speak.
### (SPEAKER pouts)|Why you...|Long ago, I made a contract with Ninril to guide lost souls back to her.|Do you doubt her blessing?!
### Your Resurrection Arts don't seem very effective.
### (SPEAKER looks puzzled)|People don't die anymore, but there are still lots of souls out there.|Whenever they stumble into the dungeon, searching for answers,|I'm still here, waiting!
### What do you do now that people don't die?
### (SPEAKER chortles)|So you've noticed!|As you can see, Ninril is very powerful~
### You don't look very old yourself.
### (SPEAKER frowns)|Divine blessings shouldn't be used for such silly things!
### Can you resurrect my back? It kind of hurts right now...
### (SPEAKER smiles)|Those latex-clad idiots don't understand a thing.|Science can only get you so far!|Worship is where it's at!
### The Alchemists are always looking for a youth potion.
### (SPEAKER folds her arms)|Oh ho ho~|That's none of your business, for it is also part of my contract|to keep outsiders from interfering with the catacombs below!
### Do you know what's on the next floor?
### (SPEAKER blushes)|Nope, nothing at all!|In fact, whatever it is, you won't find it down here!|Now, would you like to become my pet?
### Do you know anything about the Old Civilization?
### (SPEAKER shrugs)|Oh really...|Must be the fey playing tricks, hehe...
### I've seen a few robots running around!
### (SPEAKER looks nervous)|Oh yeah? Where'd you hear that?|The 'adventurer's guild,' huh?|Why don't you just leave the dead to rest~
### I heard there was an ancient facility on this island.
### (SPEAKER sighs)|Look, the Goddess doesn't tell me everything.|Now then, I have a job to do and some pets to manage.|Please stop asking questions!
### Is Sariel Vinlaga down here?
### (SPEAKER frowns)|What's with all the questions!|There totally isn't some kind of doll processing facility here!|Perhaps you're a brainwashed doll yourself?
### Does DressUp Co. get their 'cyber doll' products from here?
### (SPEAKER chuckles)|I smell a hint of jealousy~
### I don't want to be a pet, so you'll have to force me.
### (SPEAKER jumps up and down)|You would!?|That's wonderful~|My resurrection magic can make you young again forever!|All you have to do is pledge your soul to Nirin, the Goddess of Restoration!
### I'd love to be your pet!
### (SPEAKER pouts)|Hmmph. Suit yourself.
### Pledge my soul? That changes things...
### (SPEAKER giggles)|Hehe... you sound interested.
### (SPEAKER frowns)|Never ask a woman about her age!
### I take it you're the hag in charge?
### You are in charge, right?
### (Giggle)
### Don't mess with me, little girl.
### Mmpphgh? (Pout at her)
### (She smirks)|So you're that kind of visitor, huh?
### That's right. How powerful are you?
### (She cracks her knuckles)|I have been practicing the resurrection arts for a thousand years.
### (She smiles)|All the zombies you seee in the Graveyard?|They are my pets, and I care for each and every one of them.
### What the heck are 'Resurrection Arts'?
### It's time for a true display of skill!
### Hmmph. (Look away)
### (She grins)|We'll wipe that pout off your face soon enough...
### (She frowns)|Well, you will soon.
### Pfff. Never heard of it.
### I bet I could do better.
### Why does that matter to you?
### (Stare at her silently, maintaining your posture)
### (She grins)|I am in charge of this place.|Everything that goes through here goes through me.|You may address me as Fuuka Windsong.
### By what authority?
### (SPEAKER tilts her head)|Ummmm.... uh...|The Old Civilization! Of course!|I've been keeping their traditions for centuries.
### (SPEAKER blushes)|Umm... That's because...|Oh shut up!
### You don't sound too confident.
### Who are you anyway?
### Fair enough. I am an adventurer.
### (SPEAKER giggles)|Is that a challenge?
### (Nod calmly)
### (SPEAKER grins)|Is that a challenge?
### We'll see about that.
### Hmmph. (Scoff into your gag)
### It is indeed!
### I'm an adventurer, miss.
### Mmmpphh~ (Moan and wiggle seductively)
### (She grins)|Oh look at you!|I'm going to dress you up and make you my pet!|You can have all the scritches and snuggles you want!|My name's Fuuka!
### A pet? What kind?
### (SPEAKER hops up and down excitedly)|Oh I've got dresses!|And all sorts of fun gear!|Maybe even this huge gag for you to chew on!
### (SPEAKER grins)|Having second thoughts?
### That sounds... harsh.
### ...Maybe
### Exciting!
### That sounds great. But who are you miss?
### Mmmmph~
### (SPEAKER giggles)|Hehe... We will have so much fun~
### (SPEAKER giggles)|You don't have to consent, dear~
### I never said I consented to being a pet!
### (Give her a puzzled look and shake your head)
### No way!
### (Sigh and shrug)
### (Attack her without saying anything)

### (SPEAKER clears her throat)|I am the one tasked with keeping this graveyard pure and holy.|The reincarnated ones who roam this place do so with my permission.|But what of you? I do not remember striking a deal with you.|Are you here to challenge me?
### I do what I want.
### (Glare at her and scoff)
### (SPEAKER makes a big grin)|I take that you wish to challenge me?|Very well!|Come at me!
### About those 'reincarnated ones'...
### You have no power over me
### Hmmph. (Stand proudly)
### (SPEAKER smiles)|Then let us fight!|If I win, I will make you my pet.|If you win, I will let you pass.
### I don't want to fight, miss...
### Mmph! (Shake your head frantically)
### (SPEAKER giggles)|Come now, I want to see how good you are!
### Yes, I am here to fight you.
### (SPEAKER smiles)|Then what are we waiting for?

### You're on!
### Hmmmph!
### Let us duel!
### Mmmmmghh!
### I suppose...

### (SPEAKER smiles as she stands over you)|Well well. Look who won.
### (SPEAKER nods and giggles)|Absolutely.|Allow me to present to you, my prized pet collar!|I save it only for my favorite pets.|That's right! You're my favorite pet now~
### (SPEAKER giggles)|You're not in a position to resist.|Now then, where did I put that collar...
### (SPEAKER smiles)|It's a magical spell that seals your power temporarily~|I use it for my pets when they're being unruly...|(She brandishes a collar) Now including you!
### What's this weird magic?
### You beat me fair and square.
### Mmmph. (Submit)
### You cheated!
### Mmmph! (Struggle weakly)
### (Sigh and accept your fate)
### (Accept the collar eagerly)
### (Accept the collar begrudgingly)
### (SPEAKER presents you with your collar...)|(She locks it around your neck)|You are free to go now, dear!

### (SPEAKER puts up a wall of talismans to regain her strength)|I'm... I'm not finished yet!

### (SPEAKER is out of breath)|I... can't... believe... it...|She drops her keys...
### (SPEAKER looks flabbergasted)|R-really? Okay... I'll give you a reward then...
### (Submit to her anyway) (Gain a special collar)
### (SPEAKER resists but ultimately you force a gag into her mouth)|MMMMMPH!
### (Gag her)




### (This ghost had something to say,|but it appears you've run into a bug instead)|Please report this to Ada18980 on deviantart!

### (Continue)
### (Make a smug face as you walk past)
### Thank you!
### I don't need your advice, strange ghostly person.


### Oh, those people that locked you up?|I dealt with them.|Now come along, there's no time to waste!
### (The SPEAKER giggles)|Treasure? The treasure isn't going anywhere.|Plus, I made a few enemies on the way.|We better not wait till they come back.
### But what about the treasure!?
### (The SPEAKER ponders your question)|I think we'll have to talk about compensation|AFTER we get out of here.
### So how much is this going to cost me?

### (You hear footsteps. It's the SPEAKER!)|Why look at you!|Well you seem to be in a bind, don't you?
### Not to worry! I'll get you out of here!
### Hehe, alright! If that's what you want~

### (Shake your head and refuse rescue)
### Actually I was having fun...

### (The SPEAKER, your longtime friend, smiles)|Well well, if it isn't you again!|I see that you've decided to challenge the dungeon again.|Don't forget to bring some gold back with you,|there's a fee for rescue~

### Can you help with these restraints?
### Pfffmmm hhmmph mmph... (Please Help Me)
### No can do! Even I can't get those off of you.

### Caught by...?
### Hah!|You've been here a million times!|You obviously know how dangerous it is, yes?
### F-fee? There's a fee?
### Yep! It'll cost ya!|Quite worth it if you ask me.|Unless you'd like to spend the rest of your life in chains!
### Will you buy my loot?
### (Show her your loot)
### Absolutely! I offer the standard market rate for anything.|I'll take enchanted items too!|I've got plenty of volunteers to check for curses~
### Got something you want to show me?
### (Sell Items)
### (Sell Whole Stacks of Items)
### Daww! What a cutie!|(She smiles and pats your head gently)

### Do you have anything for sale?
### (Look around for items to buy)
### I'm sorry sweetie, I don't sell merchandise here.|Who would set up a shop inside a dungeon? That's crazy!|But you adventurers bring in a steady supply of loot,|so if you've got something to sell me, I'll take it off your hands~|You can also talk to my guests, perhaps they have something for you.

### (Return)


### (The SPEAKER brings you safely back to her shop)|There! Nice and safe.|Now, as for my fee...|That'll be RESCUECOST gold pieces!

### Right! Here's RESCUECOST gp.
### Mmmph. (Nod your head and pay RESCUECOST gp)
### (The SPEAKER smiles)|Pleasure doing business with ya~

### Mind adding it to my tab?
### (Shake your head regrettably.)
### (The SPEAKER rubs her chin)|Ah... hmm, well...|I guess I'll let you off this time.|But I won't be letting you out of those restraints~
### (The SPEAKER rubs her chin)|Ah... hmm, well...|I guess I'll let you off this time.|You're a good customer, after all.
### (The SPEAKER folds her arms)|Come on now, I can hear the gold jingling in your pocket!

### Pretty please? I promise I'll pay you back.
### (Be insistent)
### (The SPEAKER rubs her chin)|Fine, I believe you.|But I won't be letting you out of those restraints!
### (The SPEAKER sighs)|Fine, I believe you.|You better believe I won't forget, though!

### (The SPEAKER folds her arms)|Your adventures have cost me a pretty penny.|I can't stay in business if my clients keep running off without paying.|Look, I'll cut you a deal, you help me, I help you. Fair?

### (Help her test cursed armors)
### (Add cursed restraints as collateral)
### (Wear a collar to help advertise her business)
### (Wear a catsuit to help advertise her business)
### (Actually... just pay her the RESCUECOST gold)

### (The SPEAKER holds up a RESTRAINTNAME)|I've bought some armors from an adventurer lately,|but I don't know if they're safe to wear.|Why don't you try it on for me?|I'll postpone your debt for a later time.
### (The SPEAKER holds up a RESTRAINTNAME)|I need to make sure you won't go running off again.|This RESTRAINTNAME here has a special seal on it.|I can get you out of it, of course, but you'll have to pay up first.
### (The SPEAKER holds up a RESTRAINTNAME)|Your captors are quite the market for high-security restraints.|If you get captured by them, maybe they'll see my logo on this collar!|It's quite comfy and secure,|you'll end up feeling more submissive the more your wear it.
### (The SPEAKER holds up a RESTRAINTNAME)|Your body looks like a great billboard!|This suit will make you so attractive that nobody will be able to resist!|And in the process of, ahem, examining you,|They'll be sure to see my logo!
### (The SPEAKER folds her arms and nods)|Good girl! I knew you would come clean~

### Sure! I accept!
### (Nod in approval)
### How about something else?

### Excellent! Please hold still~|(She fits the RESTRAINTNAME on and a seal awakens)|Whoops! Good thing I didn't sell that one!|I'll let you keep it, it's my treat~
### Excellent! Please hold still~|(She fits the RESTRAINTNAME on and nothing happens)|We have a winner!|You can't have it though, not until you pay up~
### Wonderful. I look forward to seeing you being delivered, er, coming back,|Lots of treasure in hand!|(She places the RESTRAINTNAME on you and the seal activates. There is no keyhole.)
### Alright! Why don't you hold still~|(She lifts your hair out of the way and buckles the collar on)|Now go out there and find me some treasure~
### You're gonna like it, I guarantee it~|(She pulls out the catsuit from a drawer, dusts it off, and helps you in it)|(There is no zipper or fastener, just a very stretchy neck hole)|(Once it's on and well-fitted, you feel the neck grow less loose...)|(...and pulling the rubber away from your skin becomes impossible)|Beautiful. I'm going to let you go now.|I'm sure your new look will attract many customers!

### No? That's alright.|I'm sure I'll find someone else to test these on, huehue.
### Up to you!|You'll still have to pay me eventually~
### Your choice~|I am open to further negotiations.
### Your choice~|Not everyone is up to putting themselves on display like that~



### (The SPEAKER pats you down and makes sure you're okay)|I can definitely help with those!|But as you know, I help a lot of adventurers just like you.|You know what, I'll give you a discount!|That'll be RESCUECOST gold pieces!


### (The SPEAKER rubs her chin)|Sorry miss!|Cost of doing business, you know?|Why don't you come back with some of that delicious, shiny gold~
### (The SPEAKER folds her arms)|Business is business, miss~

### (The SPEAKER rubs her chin)|No can do.|Rules are rules~
### (The SPEAKER sighs)|Business is business, miss~

### (The SPEAKER reluctantly frees you)|...Fine, I'll cut you a deal.|You help me, I help you. Fair?






### The next floor is a normal floor.
### This floor is suffering from a slime mold infestation.|Maids have been deployed to deal with the problem.|They could use a hand.
### This floor is being ransacked by bandits.|They are armed and dangerous.|But I hear there's a bounty on their heads?
### A cave dragon was captured in the next floor.|It's brimming with elemental magic,|and there are a lot of interested parties!
### The witches told me to keep you out.|I'm not exactly capable of doing that,|so feel free to do as you please.
### The next floor is overgrown.|I'd watch your feet if I were you.
### Slimes, slimes EVERYWHERE!|Fortunately there's a slime-harvesting|operation going on.
### The trainers are taking their wolfgirls out for a walk.|I'd steer clear.|Unless you want to become one of their pets~
### Rumor has it that one of the cyber-dolls escaped.|Their handlers are looking for her.|They're catching every young girl they can find!
### This is totally a normal floor.|No doubt about it.


### This is a debug mode journey for testing the latest region.


### These are the stairs to the tutorial hall.

### Congratulations! You've completed the tutorial!|Now get in there and stay out of trouble~

### Welcome to the dungeon!|Don't panic, this is a turn-based game,|and nothing will happen until you move.|On your left you'll see your character,|displayed with all of the bondage they don't have.|Don't worry, you'll find some soon!

### You might be wondering what all these barrels are for.|Don't worry, they're, uh, totally safe!|When you are inside one you can click on yourself to wait.|Enemies have a hard time seeing you inside a barrel,|so you can wait until they pass by you.

### On the right you'll see your stats and spells slots.|Your DP, SP, MP, and WP are displayed there, we'll get into what these do.|Below that you'll see your current consumable items,|your gold, and your currently equipped weapon.
### Your WP, or willpower, is an important resource.|Without it, escaping from restraints is more difficult.|There is a willpower potion on the floor up there. Go get it!
### Oh no! That trap reduced your willpower!|Fortunately you have a potion.|You can drink it by clicking the '+' icon next to your WP bar.|You can also go into your Inventory in the bottom bar.|There is also a quick-inventory icon (backpack).
### Another trap!|You'll notice that the trap also drained your stamina considerably, preventing you from sprinting or attacking.|(Note: you can toggle sprinting using the '>>' button on the bottom bar)|You can protect yourself while your stamina regenerates by retreating into the room above.|Close the door by clicking the Close Door button in the bottom bar.|

### Your MP, or Mana, used used to cast spells.|In order to cast spells though, you need to learn one.|Click the Spells button in the right menu, then navigate to the Spell Tree.|Then click on Flame Apprentice and learn it to unlock Firebolt.|Then, press space to go back, and press Right to switch pages.|Click on Firebolt, learn it, then assign it to slot 1.
### On the right you'll see your stats and spells slots.|You can click on a spell slot or hit 1-4 on your keyboard to cast a spell|then click on the map for where you want to aim it.|The small wrench icon above them will let you|swap them out for another spell from your spellbook.
### There's a zombie over there!|Fortunately zombies are weak to fire.|Firebolt has a very long range,|so simply cast firebolt and click on the zombie.|Repeat until it is dead.
### Mana potions restore mana, allowing you to cast spells.|Youll notice that your mana also regenerates slowly.|This mana comes from your mana pool,|which is a thin line displayed under the mana bar.|When that runs out, you can't cast spells anymore!

### Your DP, or Distraction, is a measure of...|How much you are enjoying things.|These sorts of thoughts cloud your mind,|so spellcasting is more difficult when you are distracted.|Go grab the potion over there.
### Did you like that?|Anyway, there's a zombie over there. You should drink that potion.|It will clear your mind so you can cast again.|Hurry, or it will get you!


### That wasn't so hard, was it?|Now then, there's a treasure chest over here. Why don't you open it?
### Yikes, looks like you're in a bind!|No worries, though. There's a key to those cuffs over there.|Simply hover over the cuffs item test on the left side.|Then, click the lock icon to remove the lock.|Finally, click the buckle to remove the cuffs.
### I think we all know what's in the next chest.|It's important to understand the different ways you can escape.|You can struggle, which costs the most stamina|but makes other struggle methods faster.|You can cut, which requires a knife in hand.|You can remove, which represents untying or unbuckling.
### Ouch, that looked tight...|Sometimes you won't be able to struggle out of things.|You'll have to find some other way to take it off...
### There's a few zombies up ahead.|Fight your way through and claim the treasure!

### You're not feeling it...
### You close your eyes but the vibrations keep you from dozing off...

### (A SPEAKER lies hogtied in front of you)|(She looks at you with pleading eyes,)|(and mumbles incoherently through her gag)
### (A SPEAKER lies hogtied in front of you)|(She looks at you, mumbling and giggling into her gag)
### (SPEAKER looks grateful)|Thank you so much|I shall join your party.
### (SPEAKER looks grateful)|Thank you so much miss!|I owe you everything.
### (SPEAKER groans and wriggles around uselessly)
### (SPEAKER moans and rolls around, blushing deeply)
### Untie her
### Make sure she is tight and secure

### (A SPEAKER bumps into you while immersed in her thoughts)|Oh! Hello!|Say, you look adorable...|Do you mind helping me find something?
### (The SPEAKER jumps up and down)|Ah, wonderful!|I've misplaced one of my dresses.|If you could find one, wear it, and bring it to me,|I'd greatly appreciate it! Thanks!
### (The SPEAKER stares at you like a rabid animal)|Wowie! You look gorgeous!|Thank you so much!|(She snaps a photo of you using a magic crystal)
### (The SPEAKER giggles)|I never said I'd take it off, did I?
### (The SPEAKER smiles)|Sure thing!
### (Show interest)
### I found your dress...
### Mmmph... (Found the dress!)
### Great! Can you take it off?
### Mmmmm! (Struggle)

### (A SPEAKER clutching her books approaches you)|Miss adventurer!|I happen to need a magic scroll of any kind.|It's for my studies.
### (The SPEAKER smiles)|Yes, thank you so much!|It's been so difficult to get them lately.|The magic library is closed off these days,|and there are mean people trying to get the scrolls back...
### (The SPEAKER is happy)|Thank you so much!
### Give her a Scroll of Sauntering
### Give her a Scroll of Sleight
### Give her a Scroll of Speech
### Give her a Scroll of Purity

### (A SPEAKER looks distraught)|Well met, adventurer!|We have a problem...
### (The SPEAKER folds her arms)|A rebel has been causing us problems lately...|If you run into her, give her all you got!|She needs to be brought to justice.

### (A SPEAKER scoffs in your direction)|Well? You lookin' for work or no?
### (The SPEAKER grins)|A bunch of delinquents stormed out recently.|They're looking for a way out of their belts.|Someone oughta show em their place,|if you catch what I'm saying.

### (A SPEAKER approaches you in your cell)|Since you've been a bad girl,|we're taking you to the high-security prison.
### (The SPEAKER folds her arms)|Want to or not, you're going.
### (Resist)
### (Submit)

### (A SPEAKER approaches you in your cell)|Looks like you're not in the System.|I'm going to have to take you to sorting.
### (The SPEAKER grins as her systems glow)|I love my job sometimes~
### (The SPEAKER grins)|It means you'll get nicely packaged,|so that we can sort you through the System.
### W-what does that entail?
### (The SPEAKER giggles)|That means we'll get to package you up and|decide what to do with you, silly~
### Hmmmph? Mmmm! (Act worried and whimper)
### (The SPEAKER folds her arms)|Mistress Oriel's orders 
### Not in the 'System'?
### (The SPEAKER giggles)|Don't worry, we'll get you sorted out soon.|After all, everyone has a place in the System.
### Mmmph? (Act confused)
### (The SPEAKER folds her arms)|Mistress Oriel's orders were clear:|Anyone not logged in the System shall be entered into the System.
### (The SPEAKER pauses for a moment, then speaks)|I'm am just following Mistress Oriel's orders.|I'm sure she will have time to speak with you if you want to ask her.
### But why???
### (The SPEAKER frowns)|You should be thankful.|Without Mistress Oriel, we'd all be dead!|Probably...
### Who is Mistress Oriel?
### (The SPEAKER pauses for a moment, then answers)|Well, only a few hundred years ago, I think?|This is a bit longer of a downtime than usual,|But all of us are waiting patiently~
### When are these orders from?
### (You anger the SPEAKER. She gags you.)|Unlike you, we were trained not to complain about orders given to us.|So until you receive your training, why don't you be nice and quiet?
### The facility is in ruins! This is pointless!

### (A SPEAKER crosses her arms)|Who you lookin' at?|Oh, it's an adventurer.|Say, you wouldn't be interested|in working with us, would ya?
### (The SPEAKER smiles)|That's more like it.|Here's the scoop: One of ours was captured on the next floor.|We need you to go get her out.

### (The SPEAKER sits bound in high-security manacles.|You'll need to open the lock to get her out.)
### (You don't have any keys that work on the lock)
### (You can't help her, bound as tightly as you are...)
### (You unlock her, fumbling around for a while with your bound hands)
### (You unlock the SPEAKER)|Thank you!|Let's get out of here!
### (You unlock the SPEAKER)|Mmmmph!|(She wants to keep her gag...)
### (You don't have any lockpicks)
### (You try to pick the lock...)|(Click! A safety shield locks securely into place!)|(Looks like the SPEAKER will be staying here for a while...)
### (You can't pick the lock with your hands bound)
### (After a while, you free the SPEAKER)|Thank you!|Let's get moving!
### (After a while, you free the SPEAKER)|Mmmmph!|(She shakes her head when you go for her gag...)
### (You don't have enough mana for a command word)
### (Try as you might, your mouth is sealed tight)
### (You utter a command word to free the SPEAKER)|Many thanks!|Let's go!
### (You utter a command word to free the SPEAKER)|Mmmmph!|(She locks her gag back on...)
### (The SPEAKER is locked in high-security manacles.|The safety shield has been triggered, making it impossible to help her.)

### Use a key to unlock her
### Try to pick her restraints (JAMPERCENT jam chance)
### Use a command word
### Apologize profusely!




### (The SPEAKER sits restrained by your own hand.|Only someone with keys can let her out.)

### Try to pick her restraints
### Return her to your collection
### Flip her around
### You spin her right round!



### An enemy found you while you were busy!

### (A SPEAKER wakes you up by banging on the bars)|Wake up! Let's get out of here!|(She managed to pick the lock on your cell door)
### (A SPEAKER wakes you up by melting the door with acid)|These guys were a piece of cake.|Now let's discover a way out of here!
### (You wake up to find a SPEAKER creeping up outside the door)|You've been marked as a person of interest.|We are here to escort you out of this place.
### (A SPEAKER wakes you up by banging on the bars)|Hey wake up!|You should join me and my pals here~|Maybe you'll join them once we're out of here?
### (A SPEAKER wakes you up by banging on the bars)|I have been sent to inform you...|...that you are of good standing with the Council.|That being said, I'm only doing this because of procedure.
### (A SPEAKER wakes you up by banging on the bars)|Greetings, follower of the blessed kitty!|Because of your faith, we have been sent to rescue you!
### (You sense a presence nearby and look up to see a SPEAKER)|Because you are one, we have come to free you.|Do not take this as an excuse|to get yourself into further trouble.
### (A SPEAKER wakes you up with the sound of copious fabric rustling)|Oh why hello there!|Would you be interested in a trial run of my latest product?|Of course, we'll have to get you out of here first...
### (A SPEAKER wakes you up by banging on the bars)|Hello my pretty~|I thought to myself I'd rather have you than these folk.|Now why don't you come along and follow me...
### (A SPEAKER wakes you up by banging on the bars)|Um... hello!|I received a quest to help you out of here!|Now, where do we go...
### (You wake up to find a SPEAKER whispering to you)|Greetings.|We've been sent to free you.|Let's get moving.
### (A SPEAKER wakes you up by banging loudly)|Hey! Good news!|My friends and I came to rescue you!
### (A SPEAKER wakes you up by knocking on the bars)|Hey, wake up.|I happen to like you, so we're going to get you out of here.
### (A SPEAKER flashes a bright light in your direction)|Prisoner 74121 located. Commence transfer to different location.
### (A SPEAKER wakes you up)|We came to rescue you. Come on!

### (The bed looks comfy and inviting)|(Napping here will restore up to half of your willpower and 100% of your max mana)|(You can only sleep once per floor, unless jailed)
### (You lay in the bed and doze off...)
### (Lie down and sleep)

### (There is a pole sticking out of the ground)|(A footrest rises from the floor on either side of the pole)|(This seems like an automated binding system for prisoners...)
### (The pole rises and immobilizes you!)
### (Stand over it and place your feet in the footrests)
### (Drop off a prisoner from your collection)
### (Put NME on the stand) (PRCNT% Chance)
### (Put NME on the stand)
### (This is a piece of bondage furniture)
### (You lock yourself in the furniture!)
### (The SPEAKER slips out of your grip|before you can lock her in place!)
### (Display one of your prisoners)
### (Lock yourself inside)

### (Try to lock NME into the furniture) (PRCNT% Chance)
### (You close the furniture around your unfortunate victim!)
### Stun or disable her first.
### (Secure NME into the furniture)
### (You lock her into the furniture so that she stays in place)


### FOODMSG|(It invites you to partake in its culinary delights)
### (You eat the food and feel your willpower rising)
### (Being gagged as you are you cannot enjoy the food)
### (You steal the food, hoping nobody will notice...)

### Quite a boast for someone who's about to lose.
### (SPEAKER grins)|I look forward to testing those claims~
### I defeated Fuuka. Now you're next!
### (SPEAKER shrugs)|You beat that zombie girl?|She's the weakest of the paladins.|She loves to boast about how she's special,|But she's really just a spoiled brat.
### ...Zombie girl?
### (SPEAKER tilts her head)|Yes, she was around before Vinlaga.|Her magic was gifted to her by the Goddess,|it is only natural that it works on her too.
### ...Paladins?
### (SPEAKER nods happily)|Divinely-appointed judges, presiding over mortals.|Unlike you, our immortality is earned.|Myself, I captured many defilers long ago.|Is it not fitting that I get to keep them for myself?
### It is an honor to fight a worthy opponent.
### (SPEAKER giggles)|That gag suits you nicely~
### (SPEAKER grins)|I look forward to it!

### Tell me about your collection
### (SPEAKER smiles pleasantly)|Its a fitting reward, isn't it?|Long ago, this mountain was home to a vicious empire.|Machines went out to sea, bringing back countless prisoners.|As commander of the invasion, I earned this title!
### (SPEAKER grins)|When we stormed the prisons, we encountered many fierce defenders.|Many of them now reside in these halls, earning their rightful punishment.
### Who are the prisoners, anyway?
### (SPEAKER folds her arms)|Is it not holy and just to bring down tyrants?
### Why did the Goddesses intervene?
### (SPEAKER shrugs)|Most of them had already been... conditioned.|It will take centuries to undo centuries of training.|After all, we have plenty of time.
### What about the former prisoners?
### (SPEAKER looks to the side)|The leader was nowhere to be found.|The coward fled deeper underground.|Her robot guardians protect her, to this day.
### Can I see the leader of this old civilization?
### (SPEAKER smirks)|What's the point of going deeper?|The tyrant lost control of her petty empire.|Now the world is safe from her.
### So you stopped at the upper floors?
### (SPEAKER frowns)|Absolutely not.|They are under my strict supervision.
### Can I talk to the former prisoners?
### (SPEAKER grins)|Very funny.|I heard rumors of an up-and-coming adventurer stirring up trouble.|It seems my intuitions were correct.
### I hope you don't mind me looting the lower levels~
### (SPEAKER grins)|Oh please.|Only this era's finest warriors can be part of my collection~|My subordinates take care of the rest.
### Sounds like you have an impressive collection
### (SPEAKER frowns)|It's easy to take for granted the peace you didn't work for.
### Must be comfy living up here then
### (SPEAKER scoffs at you)|Adventurers are always like this.|Ever since your kind started prying,|I've had no choice but to enact my own kind of discipline~
### What makes you any better than the old rulers?
### (SPEAKER smirks at you)|If that were so, then perhaps it would be best not to pry...|Forbidden knowledge has its price, after all.
### It sounds like the gods are trying to hide something
### (SPEAKER folds her arms)|And what makes you think an old myth would be relevant here?|Would the Archmagus herself lead a rebellion against the divine?
### Was Sariel Vinlaga the leader of the old civilization?
### (SPEAKER frowns)|You don't trust me? That's too bad...
### It's the way you keep dodging questions.
### (SPEAKER scoffs)|I'd love to have a word with your sources~

### I won't wear anyone's collar!
### (She smirks)|Tsk tsk. Then you won't pass.
### (She giggles)|How cute!|You're so used to yours that you forgot about it~
### Why don't you wear it yourself?
### Hmmph. (Scoff at her)
### (She frowns)|Watch your tongue~
### (She frowns)|I do not wear collars.
### You'd be better off wearing mine instead.
### You're missing out~
### This is a nice place you got here.
### (Admire the locale)
### (SPEAKER smiles and nods)|It has existed for a thousand years,|and it shall exist for another thousand.|No thanks, of course, to the adventurers who storm through here,|breaking the orbs as if it all belongs to them...
### What are these orbs for anyway?
### (SPEAKER looks puzzled)|You don't know? Surely you must be joking?
### (SPEAKER shrugs)|They are important because...|Wait, you're stalling for time, aren't you?
### I do not know.
### (Sigh)
### Of course I know...
### You can trust me.
### Mmmph! (Nod eagerly)
### (SPEAKER laughs)|Do you think I will trust you just like that?
### (SPEAKER frowns)|You do not know who you're dealing with.|I'll make sure to teach you a lesson.
### Why don't I make you wear it?
### You can try~
### There must be a mistake. Sign me up!
### (She smiles)|Eager are we?|I don't just record anyone though.|I only care about the strongest adventurers~
### I am the strongest.
### (SPEAKER chuckles)|Then why don't I test your skills?
### (SPEAKER grins)|How about trial by combat?
### A test? What kind?
### ...You're on!
### Let's do it!
### You will see how strong I am!
### (SPEAKER giggles)|We'll see about that!
### On second thought, maybe not...
### (SPEAKER giggles)|Not so confident, are we?
### I didn't think it would involve a test...

### (SPEAKER readies her whip)|Allow me to introduce myself properly.|I am The Warden, divinely appointed judge and enforcer.|Those who enter this mountain do so under my watchful eye.|To ensure this, I have crafted a special collar.|It will ensure that you do not defile the holy places.|I can let you through if you accept it~
### I will never be collared by you!
### (Shake your head and scoff)
